Benching process is also adopted for digging small tunnels.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Among the following, which can be adopted for providing support for soft strata?<br>
a) Bents of aluminum<br>
b) Bents of iridium<br>
c) Bents of steel<br>
d) Bents of plastic<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: c<br>
Explanation: The provision of soft strata must be done for withstanding the excavation. It can be provided by bents of wood, bents of steel, liner plates and poling, which are placed to retain material between the adjacent bents.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">A steel cylinder which is pushed in the soft soil is determined as ________<br>
a) Jar born<br>
b) Shield<br>
c) Rod<br>
d) Pole<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: b<br>
Explanation: In the case of soft grounds, tunneling can be dangerous and cave-ins are common. To prevent this, an iron or steel cylindrical element called shield is placed in the soft soil, which can crave the hole perfectly.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Which method can be adopted in case of rock tunneling?<br>
a) Full face method<br>
b) Benching<br>
c) Tracing<br>
d) Back bearing method<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: a<br>
Explanation: Rock tunneling involves the same principle as of the tunneling in the ground. Those include full face method, top heading method and drift method. Based on the conditions of the area, these can be adopted.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Which of the following can act as an alternative for blasting?<br>
a) Tunneling<br>
b) Continuous blasting<br>
c) Sequential blasting<br>
d) Fire-setting<br>
</p>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: d<br>
Explanation: Blasting is the conventional method which is adopted in case of rock tunneling. In the case of fire-setting, tunnel is heated with fire and then cooled with water. Rapid expansion and contraction weakens and rock and tends to break.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Which of the following involves in the sequence of rocky strata?<br>
a) Marking profile<br>
b) Placing rocks<br>
c) Improving foul gases<br>
d) Recording values<br>
</p>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: a<br>
Explanation: Rocky strata involve usage of blasting method for developing tunnels. The sequence contains marking profile, loading explosive, removing foul gases, checking, scaling, mucking and bolting.</div></div>
