    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quarrying by wedging</strong> is successful for: Sandstone, Limestone, Marble</li>
        <li><strong>For hard stone quarrying</strong>, methods used include: Wedging, Channeling machine, Blasting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Dressing</h3>
    <p>The process of shaping and sizing stones, usually done at the quarry site.</p>
    
    <h3>Seasoning</h3>
    <p>Freshly quarried stones contain quarry sap, which reduces strength and causes issues like efflorescence. Seasoning removes this sap.</p>
    </section>
 <section id="Cementing Materials (Lime and Cement)">
    <h2>Cementing Materials (Lime and Cement)</h2>
    <h3>Lime</h3>
    <p>Lime is a rigid binding material used since ancient times in construction. It is used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Concrete and mortar matrix</li>
        <li>Low-cost building joints</li>
        <li>Whitewashing and distempering</li>
        <li>Timber knotting</li>
        <li>Steel manufacturing</li>
        <li>Historical preservation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Manufacture of Lime</h3>
    <p>Lime is produced by burning limestone, a process called <strong>calcination</strong>. This produces <strong>quick lime (CaO)</strong>, which is then slaked with water to produce <strong>slaked lime (Ca(OH)₂)</strong>.</p>
    
    <h3>Sources</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Limestone:</strong> Used in flooring, mortar, cement manufacturing</li>
        <li><strong>Kankar:</strong> Used for hydraulic lime in substructures</li>
        <li><strong>Sea animal shells:</strong> Used for ornamental shell lime</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Process of Manufacture</h3>
    <h4>1. Collecting Materials</h4>
    <p>Pure limestone (impurity &lt;5%) is used for fat lime; Kankar is used for hydraulic lime. Fuel sources include wood, coal, coke, and charcoal.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Burning</h4>
    <h5>Clamp Burning</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional method, inefficient</li>
        <li>Alternative layers of limestone and fuel</li>
        <li>Not suitable during rainy seasons</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Kiln Burning</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Intermittent kiln: Constructed in hills/rivers, limestone stacked over an arch</li>
        <li>Continuous kiln: Large-scale production, pure lime, coal-fired</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>3. Slaking of Lime</h4>
    <p>The process of converting quick lime into slaked lime:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Air Slaking:</strong> Absorbs moisture from air, incomplete process</li>
        <li><strong>Basket Slaking:</strong> Lime is immersed in water briefly, incomplete process</li>
        <li><strong>Platform Slaking:</strong> Water is added to lime in controlled conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Tank Slaking:</strong> Used for making lime paste, ensuring purity</li>
    </ul>      

<h2>Types of Lime</h2>

<h3>Fat Lime</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Also called rich lime, high calcium lime, pure lime, white lime.</li>
    <li>Volume increases by 2.5 times on slaking.</li>
    <li>Purest lime > 95% lime.</li>
    <li>Made by burning pure limestone, animal shells.</li>
    <li>Used for white washing and lime plastering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hydraulic Lime</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Contains greater than 5% impurity in the form of clay, which imparts hydraulicity (property to dry below water).</li>
    <li>With increase in clay content, setting time under water decreases.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hydraulic Lime Types</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Feebly hydraulic:</strong> Clay 5-10%, 21 days for drying under water, 5-10 min for slacking.</li>
    <li><strong>Moderately hydraulic:</strong> Clay 11-20%, 7 days for drying under water, 2 hrs for slacking.</li>
    <li><strong>Eminently hydraulic:</strong> Clay 21-30%, 24 hours for drying under water, 5 hrs for slacking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Poor Lime</h3>
<p>Contains more than 5% impurity and is of low quality. Not used for engineering work.</p>

<h2>Setting and Hardening of Lime Mortar</h2>
<p>The process of solidification of lime mortar or concrete involves:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> → CaO + H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
    <li><strong>Carbonation:</strong> CaO + CO<sub>2</sub> → CaCO<sub>3</sub></li>
    <li><strong>Hydrolysis:</strong> Occurs due to Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> being altered by the action of silica and alumina.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lime Mortar Types</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hydraulic lime mortar:</strong> Made by mixing lime and sand in a 1:2 ratio. Used for underwater concrete, plastering, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Gouged mortar:</strong> Made by adding a small quantity of cement. Increases strength and decreases setting time.</li>
    <li><strong>Surkhi/Pozzolana mortar:</strong> Made by mixing lime and surkhi (or pozzolana). Improves strength, reduces shrinkage, and increases resistance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cement</h2>
<h3>Manufacturing of Cement</h3>
<p>The raw materials used in cement manufacturing are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lime (CaO): 60-66%</li>
    <li>Silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>): 18-25%</li>
    <li>Alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>): 3-8%</li>
    <li>Iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>): 1-5%</li>
    <li>Magnesia (MgO): 1-4%</li>
    <li>Calcium sulfate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>): 3-5%</li>
    <li>Sulfur (SO<sub>3</sub>): 1-2%</li>
    <li>Alkali: 1-2%</li>
</ul>
