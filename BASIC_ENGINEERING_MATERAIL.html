        <h2>Classification of Stones</h2>
        <p>Stones can be classified based on their geological origin, physical properties, and chemical composition.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Geological Classification</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Igneous Rocks</span>: Formed from the solidification of molten magma (e.g., Granite, Basalt).</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Sedimentary Rocks</span>: Formed by the deposition of sediments over time (e.g., Limestone, Sandstone).</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Metamorphic Rocks</span>: Formed from the transformation of existing rocks under heat and pressure (e.g., Marble, Slate).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Physical Classification</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Hard Stones</span>: Highly durable and strong (e.g., Granite, Basalt).</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Soft Stones</span>: Easily workable but less durable (e.g., Limestone, Sandstone).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Chemical Classification</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Siliceous Stones</span>: Contain silica as the main constituent (e.g., Granite, Quartzite).</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Argillaceous Stones</span>: Composed of clay minerals (e.g., Slate).</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Calcareous Stones</span>: Composed mainly of calcium carbonate (e.g., Limestone, Marble).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Properties of Good Building Stones</h2>
        <p>A good building stone should possess the following qualities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Strength</span>: Should be able to withstand loads and stresses.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Tests on Stones</h2>
        <p>To ensure quality and durability, stones undergo various tests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Crushing Strength Test</span>: Determines the load-bearing capacity of stone.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Water Absorption Test</span>: Measures the percentage of water absorbed by stone.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Stones play a crucial role in civil engineering, providing strength, durability, and aesthetic value to structures. Understanding their classification, properties, and quality tests ensures their optimal use in construction projects.</p>
