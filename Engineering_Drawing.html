        <h1>Engineering Drawing</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Drawing is the act or art of creating a picture, diagram, or representation using lines, typically with a pencil, pen, or crayon. Drawing represents objects on a two-dimensional sheet. These objects can be real or imagined by engineers, technicians, or designers.</p>
        
        <h3>Drawings are classified into two main types:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Artistic Drawing:</strong> Created by artists based on imagination, without strict rules. Different people may interpret these drawings differently.</li>
            <li><strong>Engineering Drawing:</strong> Created by engineers or technicians following standard rules, providing clear and consistent information about objects. It’s considered a universal graphic language.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>1.1 Types of Engineering Drawing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Freehand Sketch:</strong> Drawn without instruments.</li>
            <li><strong>Instrumental Drawing:</strong> Drawn using instruments for accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Computer-Aided Drawing (CAD):</strong> Created using software like AutoCAD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.3 Preparation for Drawing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Setting Up the Drawing Board:</strong> Secure the drawing paper using clips or tape to ensure it doesn’t move during the drawing process.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleaning Instruments:</strong> Ensure all drawing tools are clean and in good working condition to avoid smudges and inaccuracies.</li>
            <li><strong>Planning the Layout:</strong> Decide on the scale and layout of the drawing, including the placement of views and space for dimensions and notes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.6 Scales</h2>
        <p>Scales help represent objects proportionally on a drawing sheet. Common types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full-Size Scale (1:1):</strong> The drawing size is the same as the actual object.</li>
            <li><strong>Reducing Scale:</strong> The drawing is smaller than the actual object, e.g., 1:2, 1:5, 1:10.</li>
            <li><strong>Enlarging Scale:</strong> The drawing is larger than the actual object, e.g., 2:1, 5:1, 10:1.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.7 Dimensioning</h2>
        <p>Dimensioning conveys the exact size, shape, and location of parts. Types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dimension Lines:</strong> Indicate the size of an object, with arrowheads at each end.</li>
            <li><strong>Extension Lines:</strong> Extend from the object to show the exact points being measured.</li>
            <li><strong>Leader Lines:</strong> Point to specific features, providing additional information.</li>
        </ul>
