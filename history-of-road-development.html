            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The history of road development in Nepal is relatively short.</li>
                <li>The first motorable road was constructed in the Kathmandu Valley in **1924**.</li>
                <li>By the **1950s**, Nepal had only **376 km of roads**.</li>
                <li>As of today, Nepal's total road length stands at **18,828 km**, including district and urban roads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Government Initiatives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The **Government of Nepal** (GON) has prioritized road development since the beginning of planned development in **1956**.</li>
                <li>In **1953**, the government began linking Kathmandu to the southern border with **Indian assistance**, opening it for traffic by **1956**.</li>
                <li>In **1966**, the **Government of China** constructed the Kathmandu–Kodari road, connecting Nepal to the northern border.</li>
                <li>The **East-West Highway** (1,028 km) was initiated during this period with support from bilateral and multilateral agencies.</li>
                <li>The **Strategic Road Network (SRN)** includes national highways and feeder roads, forming the backbone of Nepal's road infrastructure.</li>
                <li>The current SRN covers **7,917 km** with plans to extend it to **9,900 km** by **2016**.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Agencies Involved in Road Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Department of Roads (DoR)</strong>: The central agency for road construction and maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>DoLIDAR</strong>: Responsible for rural infrastructure development, especially feeder roads.</li>
                <li><strong>Municipalities</strong>: Local entities managing urban road projects and maintenance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Historical Background of Roads in Nepal</h2>
            <h3>Three Key Periods of Road Development</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Before 2007 B.S. (Rana Era):</strong> The construction of roads was limited to the Kathmandu Valley with minimal infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>2007 B.S. to 2027 B.S. (Post-Rana Era):</strong> The establishment of the **Public Works Department (PWD)** and the completion of significant roads like the **Tribhuvan Rajpath** and **Kanti Rajpath**.</li>
                <li><strong>After 2027 B.S. (Modern Era):</strong> Road development strategy implemented with focus on **National Highways**, **Feeder Roads**, and **Strategic Road Networks**.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Significant Road Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tribhuvan Rajpath (2013 B.S.)</strong> - The first motorable road connecting **Kathmandu to Bhainse** built with Indian army engineers.</li>
                <li><strong>East-West Highway</strong> - A major national highway covering the full length of Nepal from east to west, initiated in **2019 B.S.**.</li>
                <li><strong>Hetauda-Narayangadh Road</strong> - A key all-weather, two-lane road completed in **2015 B.S.**.</li>
                <li><strong>Kodari Highway</strong> - Connecting Kathmandu to China, providing a significant trade route between Nepal and Tibet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Present Road Infrastructure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The **National Road Network** now comprises **18,828 km** of roads, including **4,977 km** of national highways and district roads.</li>
                <li>Out of the **77 districts**, **76** are connected to district headquarters by **national road network** (except **Humla**).</li>
                <li>**72 districts** are now accessible by **blacktopped roads**.</li>
                <li>The total length of **national highways** is approximately **14,913 km**, with around **7,000 km** of blacktopped roads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Urban Road Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Urban roads provide access to residential, business, and industrial areas within city limits.</li>
                <li>As of **2004**, **DOR** reported a total of **2,259.9 km** of urban roads in Nepal.</li>
                <li>The **Kathmandu Valley** had just **325 km of motorable roads** in **1992**, with **150 km** in poor condition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The construction of the **Outer Ring Road (ORR)**, a proposed **72 km** long route around Kathmandu to handle future traffic demands.</li>
                <li>Expansion of the **Inner Ring Road**, supported by **Chinese aid** and a proposed **8-lane** extension.</li>
                <li>Plans to connect the remaining **district headquarters** by road, with **Chame (Manang)**, **Dunai (Dolpa)**, **Simikot (Humla)**, and **Gamgadhi (Mugu)** being the last few unconnected districts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The **Mid-Hill Highway** project, aimed at improving connectivity in the mid-hills of Nepal.</li>
                <li>Widening of **Koteshwor-Bhaktapur (6-lane)** sector of **Araniko Highway** with **JICA** funding.</li>
