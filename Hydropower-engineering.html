<h1>Introduction to Hydropower</h1><h2>Introduction to Hydropower</h2>

      <p>
        Hydropower is defined as a renewable energy source generated by the movement of flowing water on the surface of the Earth.
        This energy is produced repeatedly without altering the water’s physical properties. In a hydropower plant, water is
        directed to move turbines, which in turn run electric generators. The potential energy of water stored in a dam is first
        converted into the kinetic energy of flowing water in the penstock, and then into electrical energy via the turbine–generator
        combination.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Section 2: Power & Energy Conversion -->
    <section id="power-energy">
      <h2>Power & Energy Conversion</h2>
      <p>
        The power output of a hydropower system can be calculated using the formula:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>P = ρ<sub>w</sub> × g × Q × H × n</em> (Watts)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ρ<sub>w</sub></strong> – Density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>)</li>
        <li><strong>g</strong> – Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>)</li>
        <li><strong>Q</strong> – Flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/s)</li>
        <li><strong>H</strong> – Effective head or height difference (m)</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> – Overall efficiency of the turbine–generator set</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Energy is defined as the total power consumed over a period and is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). For instance,
        using 1 kW of power continuously for 1 hour consumes 1 kWh of energy.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 5: Hydropower Potential of Nepal -->
    <section id="nepal-potential">
      <h2>Hydropower Potential of Nepal</h2>
      <p>
        Nepal possesses tremendous hydropower potential due to its abundant water resources and dramatic topography. Key factors include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Annual Runoff:</strong> Approximately 175 billion cubic meters within Nepalese territory, rising to around 200 billion cubic meters when the Tibetan drainage is included.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Topography:</strong> Ranges from the highest peaks (8848 m) to valleys below 100 m over a short distance (160–270 km), creating significant elevation differences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>River Network:</strong> More than 6,000 rivers and rivulets cross the country.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Average Annual Precipitation:</strong> About 1500 mm.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Potential Estimates</h3>
      <p>
        Nepal’s hydropower potential can be categorized into three types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gross (Theoretical) Potential:</strong> This is the total theoretical capacity based solely on the physical availability of water and topography, estimated at approximately <strong>83,000 MW</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technically Feasible Potential:</strong> This reflects the capacity that can realistically be harnessed using current technology, considering environmental and engineering constraints. Although exact figures vary, advances in technology make a large portion of the gross potential achievable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Economically Feasible Potential:</strong> Once economic, market, and infrastructure constraints are applied, the viable potential for development is around <strong>42,000 MW</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Classification Based on Operation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Isolated Plant:</strong> e.g. Micro hydropowers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grid Connected:</strong> In Nepal, the Independent National Power System (INPS) connects all projects. The grid is owned by NEA and operated through a load center at Swichatar, Kathmandu.
        </li>
      </ul>
<h2>Classification Based on Storage capacity</h2>
      <h3>Run-of-River Hydropower</h3>
      <p>
        In run-of-river plants, electricity is generated as and when water flows in the river. When the river dries up or the flow falls below a certain predetermined minimum (i.e. the minimum flow required for the turbine), electricity generation stops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the large variation in river flow in Nepal, these projects are normally designed for the dry season flows. They are suitable for perennial rivers that have adequate discharge throughout the year. The minimum dry flow must be sufficient to run the turbine efficiently and economically.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: Bhotekoshi Hydroelectric Plant (36 MW), Indrawati-III (7.5 MW), Modi Hydropower Plant (14 MW), etc.
      </p>

    <!-- Storage Type Hydropower -->
    <section id="storage-hydropower">
      <h2>Storage Type Hydropower</h2>
      <p>
        Storage plants have enough capacity to offset seasonal fluctuations in water flow and provide a constant supply of electricity throughout the year. Most rivers in Nepal show significant variations between the rainy (monsoon) season and the dry season. This variation often causes low power generation during the dry season when using run-of-river schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To mitigate this, excess water during the rainy season is stored by constructing a dam and reservoir. This stored water can be used to generate electricity during the dry season (winter). Large dams can store several years’ worth of water and may be built in non-perennial rivers. In addition, the powerhouse may be located at the toe of the dam or separated from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For example:</strong> Kulekhani-I (60 MW) and Budhigand Hydroelectric Plant (650 MW) demonstrate the storage hydropower approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Kulekhani-I Hydropower Station (60 MW):</strong> Located in Makwanpur district, it features 2 units. The project uses a Rock Fill Earthen Dam with a height of 114 m and a total reservoir capacity of 85,300,000 m³, and is equipped with Pelton turbines.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Pump Storage Plants -->
    <section id="pump-storage-plants">
      <h2>Pump Storage Plants</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike conventional hydropower plants, pump storage plants reuse water. After water produces electricity by flowing through turbines, it is discharged into a lower reservoir located beneath the dam. During off-peak hours (when energy demand is low), some of this water is pumped into an upper reservoir. Later, during periods of peak demand, the stored water is released to generate additional electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pump storage plants generate power only during peak hours, providing extra capacity to meet high demand. However, these systems are comparatively expensive.
      </p>
      <h2>Methods of Fixing Installed Capacity of a Plant</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Marginal Cost and Benefit Approach:</strong>
          <p>
            Total Marginal Cost = Annual cost of installed electromechanical equipment (AC) + additional costs (e.g., O&M costs).
          </p>
          <p>
            Marginal Benefit = Total energy generated × energy rate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Installed Capacity Optimization Approach:</strong>
          <p>
            Determine the power corresponding to different percentage levels of time available discharge (from Q25 to Q75) and trade off between cost and revenue to achieve optimum benefit.
          </p>

          (The total capacity achieved during this period is noted as "only 24" in the text, suggesting limited progress.)
        </li>
        <li>
          During the 8th Plan Period (1991/92–1996/97), additional projects were:
          <ul>
            <li>Andhikhola (5.1 MW)</li>
            <li>Jhimruk (12 MW)</li>
            <li>Chatrik (name partially given)</li>
          </ul>
          These additions brought the capacity to around 269 MW, which still indicated very slow progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
   <h2>History of Power Sector Development in Nepal</h2>
    <p>
      After 1990, the Government of Nepal recognized the drawbacks of a monopolistic power generation and distribution system. In response, it embraced liberalization by inviting the private sector to participate in power development through the Electricity Act 1992 and the Hydropower Development Policy 1992.
    </p>

    <h3>Achievements During the 9th Plan Period (1997/98–2002/03)</h3>
    <p>
      The 9th Plan Period proved to be a milestone in hydropower development, with both private and public sector initiatives making substantial progress:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Private Sector Projects:</strong> Khimti (60 MW), Bhotekoshi (36 MW), Indrawati (7.5 MW).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Government/NEA Projects:</strong> Puwakhola (6.2 MW), Modi (14 MW), Kaligandaki A (144 MW).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The combined efforts resulted in an addition of 290 MW during this period, raising the total installed hydropower capacity to 537 MW. Overall, a progress rate of 46.2% was achieved, marking this period as one of the most successful eras for hydropower development in Nepal.
    </p>

    <h2>Export of Hydropower</h2>
    <p>
      In an encouraging development, the Government of India (GoI) has granted concurrence for Nepal to export approximately 452 MW of power generated from various hydropower projects. The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) transmits this power via the Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 kV transmission line to the Day-Ahead Market of the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), with an additional 40 MW supplied in real-time.
    </p>

    <h2>Hydropower Development Policy 1992 (Modified) 2001</h2>
    <p>
      In the wake of economic liberalization and open market reforms, the policies of 1992 were modified in 2001 to restructure the power system. These reforms addressed issues such as monopoly, transparency, cost, and electricity quality while ensuring that hydropower emerged as a key alternative to biomass and thermal plants.

<h2>Sediment Deposits in a Reservoir</h2>
      <p>
        Sediment deposition is a vital consideration for the design, operation, and
        maintenance of reservoirs. Over time, sediments carried by inflowing water settle within the reservoir, reducing its effective storage capacity and potentially affecting operational efficiency.
      </p>

    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Types of Loading</h2>
      <p>
        Sediment loading occurs in various forms, primarily characterized by the size and mode of transport of the sediment particles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bed Load:</strong> Coarser sediments that move along the reservoir
          bed due to rolling or sliding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Suspended Load:</strong> Finer particles that remain in the water
          column and settle slowly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wash Load:</strong> Very fine sediments that stay almost entirely in
          suspension and are generally transported out of the reservoir.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Factors Affecting Sedimentation</h2>
      <p>
        Several factors influence the rate and extent of sediment deposition in a
        reservoir:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Inflow Velocity:</strong> Higher velocities keep sediments in
          suspension longer, reducing the rate of deposition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Watershed Characteristics:</strong> The terrain, soil type, land
          use, and land cover determine the amount of sediment that reaches the
          reservoir.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reservoir Geometry:</strong> The shape, area, and depth affect how
          and where sediments settle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seasonal Variations:</strong> Seasonal changes in rainfall and
          runoff patterns lead to episodically high sediment loads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Human Activity:</strong> Deforestation, agriculture, and
          construction practices can accelerate erosion and increase sediment
          inflow.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Sediment Control in Reservoirs</h2>
      <p>
        To mitigate the adverse effects of sediment deposition and extend the
        reservoir’s life, various control measures are implemented:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Dredging:</strong> Mechanical removal of accumulated sediments to
          restore storage capacity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flush Operations:</strong> Scheduled water releases which help
          mobilize and expel accumulated sediments downstream.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sediment Bypass Tunnels:</strong> Infrastructure designed to divert
          sediment-laden water away from the reservoir.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Watershed Management:</strong> Land use practices such as reforestation
          and soil conservation to reduce sediment inflow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Design Modifications:</strong> Incorporation of sediment traps and
          erosion-control measures in dam design.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Life of a Reservoir</h2>
      <p>
        The useful life of a reservoir is largely determined by the rate of sediment
        accumulation. As sediments deposit over time, the effective storage capacity
        diminishes, which may necessitate interventions such as dredging or other
        sediment management strategies to prolong the reservoir’s operational life.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Sediment Yield and Reservoir Trap Efficiency</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Sediment Yield</strong> refers to the amount of sediment carried
        by the inflowing water from the watershed, typically measured in tons per
        year. The <strong>Trap Efficiency</strong> of a reservoir is the ratio of
        the sediment that the reservoir retains compared to the total sediment
        inflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following table summarizes these key parameters:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Sediment Yield</td>
            <td>Quantity of sediment supplied by the catchment area (tons/year)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Trap Efficiency</td>
            <td>Percentage of incoming sediment that is retained within the reservoir</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Capacity Inflow Ratio</h2>
      <p>
        The capacity inflow ratio is a critical metric for evaluating the
        susceptibility of a reservoir to sedimentation. It is determined by comparing
        the reservoir’s total storage capacity with the annual volume of water inflow.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>low capacity inflow ratio</strong> indicates that even a small
          increase in sediment yield could significantly reduce the reservoir's
          capacity.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>high capacity inflow ratio</strong> suggests greater resilience
          to sediment accumulation as the reservoir can accommodate more sediment
          before a notable reduction in storage capacity occurs.

  <!-- Section: Purpose of Dam -->
  <h2>Purpose of Dam</h2>
  <p>
    A dam is generally most suitable in hilly areas where deep valleys offer extensive water storage. The stored water on its upstream side serves various purposes such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flood Mitigation</li>
    <li>Irrigation</li>
    <li>Water Supply</li>
    <li>Navigation</li>
    <li>Fishery and Wildlife Preservation</li>
    <li>Hydro-electric Power Generation</li>
    <li>Recreation</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Section: Types of Dam -->
  <h2>Types of Dam</h2>

  <h2>A. Classification as per Function and Use</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage Dam</strong>: Normally constructed to store excess flood water for various purposes such as irrigation, water supply, and hydropower. It may be made of concrete, earth, or rockfill (e.g., Kulekhani-1).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Detention Dam</strong>: Mainly constructed to control floods. A detention dam safeguards against possible flood damage on the downstream side. (No such dam in Nepal till date.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Diversion Dam</strong>: Used to divert river water into canals, conduits, or other streams. Typically a weir or low-level dam is constructed to raise the water level for diversion (e.g., Bheri-Babai Diversion, Sunkoshi Marine Diversion).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Debris or Check Dam</strong>: A low-height dam constructed across a stream channel to conserve soil and retain sand, gravel, driftwood, or other debris.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Coffer Dam</strong>: A temporary dam constructed to isolate the construction area from river flow during dam building.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>B. Classification as per Hydraulic Design</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Overflow Dam</strong>: Built to allow the overflow of surplus water above its top. Only a few meters of its length act as the overflow section (e.g., Rigid Dam).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Non-Overflow Dam</strong>: Designed so that water is not allowed to overtop the dam (e.g., Earth dam, rockfill dam, Kulekhani-1 dam).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>C. Classification as per Structural Design</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Gravity Dam</strong>: A solid concrete or masonry dam that resists external forces through its own weight.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Arch Dam</strong>: A curved masonry or concrete dam with the convex side facing upstream. It resists a major portion of water pressure through arch action and generally has less self-weight than a gravity dam.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Buttress Dam</strong>: Consists of an upstream sloping deck supported by several buttresses or piers constructed of reinforced concrete and supported by struts or bracings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Embankment Dams</strong>: Constructed from locally available soils, gravel, and sand that resist external forces through their shear strength. They are usually trapezoidal in section (e.g., Earth dam, earth and rock fill dam).
    </li>
