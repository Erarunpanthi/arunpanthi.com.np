<p><strong>Engineering Geology</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Geology: Geology is the science that deals with various aspects of the Earth as a planet, grouped under earth science. The term comes from &ldquo;Geo&rdquo; meaning Earth and &ldquo;logy&rdquo; meaning science. It involves studying the Earth&rsquo;s physical structure, substances, history, and the processes acting on them. Geology helps us understand the world around us and enables scientists to predict how planets will behave. For example, as populations grow, more people live in areas prone to hazards like floods and landslides. Studying geology is crucial to prevent such disasters by understanding their history and predicting future occurrences.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering Geology:</strong> This branch of applied science focuses on using geological knowledge for the safe, stable, and economical design and construction of civil engineering projects.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Definition of Engineering Geology According to IAEG</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to IAEG, &ldquo;Engineering geology is the science devoted to investigating, studying, and solving engineering and environmental problems arising from the interaction between geology and human activities, as well as predicting and developing measures for the preservation or remediation of geological hazards.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role of Engineering Geologists</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Engineering geologists interpret landforms and earth processes to identify potential geologic and man-made hazards that may impact civil structures and human development. They are trained in geology and often have specialized education in soil mechanics, rock mechanics, geotechnics, groundwater, hydrology, and civil design. This unique combination of skills helps them mitigate hazards associated with earth-structure interactions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance of Engineering Geology in Nepal</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Himalayas, especially the Nepal Himalaya, are highly fragile and delicate. Due to extreme climatography, topography, and recent human expansion, the region is vulnerable to natural calamities like floods and landslides. The Himalayan range, formed by the collision of the Tibetan and Indian plates, is the most active tectonic zone, known for its complex structural deformations. This makes Nepal prone to various geohazards and instabilities, particularly landslides and debris flows.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>BASIC REVIEWS OF THE EARTH</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Earth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The third planet from the sun and the only known object in the universe to harbor life.</li>
<li>Formed over 4.5 billion years ago, as evidenced by radiometric dating.</li>
<li>Earth&rsquo;s gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the sun and the moon, its only natural satellite.</li>
<li>Revolves around the sun in 365.25 days, known as an Earth year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Earth and other planets are believed to have formed from a solidified cloud of dust and gases left over from the creation of the sun. Initially, the Earth&rsquo;s interior remained solid and relatively cool.Over millions of years, radioactive decay of elements like uranium, thorium, and potassium released energy, causing the Earth&rsquo;s constituents to melt. Iron, being heavier, sank towards the center, forming the core, while silicates formed the crust.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major Components of the Earth System</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong></li>
<li>Surrounds the Earth in layers.</li>
<li>Protects life from direct solar radiation.</li>
<li>Gases in the atmosphere participate in cycles, with the carbon cycle being the most important.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrosphere:</strong></li>
<li>Includes all water on Earth&rsquo;s surface: oceans, lakes, rivers, aquifers, and ice.</li>
<li>Covers 70% of Earth&rsquo;s surface.</li>
<li><strong>Lithosphere:</strong></li>
<li>Covers the remaining 30% of Earth&rsquo;s surface.</li>
<li>Thickness ranges from 0 to 40 km.</li>
<li><strong>Biosphere:</strong></li>
<li>Encompasses all life on Earth, including parts of the atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere.</li>
<li>Biodiversity varies with distance from the equator, being greater closer to the equator.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earth&rsquo;s Internal Structure</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding Earth&rsquo;s interior is crucial for studying plate tectonics. Seismic studies reveal three well-defined layers: crust, mantle, and core.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Crust:</strong></li>
<li>Two types: thin oceanic crust (basalt) and thicker continental crust (granite).</li>
<li>The low density of continental crust allows it to float on the denser mantle.</li>
<li><strong>Mantle:</strong></li>
<li>Composed of olivine-rich rocks.</li>
<li>Temperature increases with depth, known as the geothermal gradient.</li>
<li>Divided into the upper mantle (cool and brittle) and lower mantle (hot and soft).</li>
<li><strong>Core:</strong></li>
<li>Composed mainly of iron and nickel alloy.</li>
<li>Source of Earth&rsquo;s internal heat due to radioactive decay.</li>
<li>Divided into a liquid outer core and a solid inner core, with the inner core remaining solid due to immense pressure.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geological time scale</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Geological Time Scale (GTS) is a system of chronological dating that relates geological strata to time, used to describe the timing and relationship of events in Earth&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p><strong>Major Evolutionary Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quaternary Period: Evolution of humans.</li>
<li>Tertiary Period: Evolution of mammals, flora, and fishes.</li>
<li>Cretaceous Period: First flowering plants, extinction of dinosaurs.</li>
<li>Jurassic Period: First birds appeared, diversification of dinosaurs.</li>
<li><strong>Mountains</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A mountain is any landmass higher than the surrounding area. Structures up to 700 meters are called hills, while those with greater relief are mountains.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Mountains</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mountain Range: </strong>A series of mountains formed during the same geological period.</li>
<li><strong>Mountain System: </strong>A group of mountain ranges of the same geological age.</li>
<li><strong>Mountain Chain: </strong>A series of mountain systems of different geological ages.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classification by Origin</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tectonic mountains: </strong>Formed due to internal forces within the Earth, usually at convergent plate boundaries. The Himalayas are a prime example.</li>
<li><strong>Volcanic mountains:</strong> Formed by volcanic eruptions, e.g., Mt. Fuji.</li>
<li><strong>Fault mountains: </strong>Formed by the displacement of Earth&rsquo;s crust along fault lines. The upthrown part is called a horst, and the downthrown part is called a graben.</li>
<li><strong>Fold mountains: </strong>Formed by the folding of Earth&rsquo;s crust when two plates collide, e.g., the Rockies.</li>
<li><strong>Residual mountains: </strong>Formed by the erosion of softer materials, leaving behind more resistant rocks.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shields</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A shield is a large area of exposed Precambrian crystalline igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks, forming tectonically stable areas. These rocks are often over 570 million years old, sometimes dating back 2 to 3.5 billion years. The Canadian Shield is an example.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plateaus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A plateau is a land area with a relatively level surface, raised above adjoining land on at least one side, often cut by deep canyons. Plateaus have a larger summit area than mountains.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formation of Plateaus</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Volcanic</strong><strong>activity:</strong>g., the Columbia Plateau in the U.S.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion: </strong>By glaciers, water, and wind.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Plateaus</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intermontane Plateaus: </strong>Surrounded by mountains, e.g., the Tibetan Plateau.</li>
<li><strong>Piedmont Plateaus: </strong>Bordered by mountains on one side and plains or seas on the other.</li>
<li><strong>Continental Plateaus: </strong>Bordered by plains or oceans, away from mountains.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plate Tectonics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Plate tectonics involves the movement and interaction of Earth&rsquo;s plates. The Earth&rsquo;s crust is divided into seven large plates and several smaller ones, which move around on the semi-molten mantle due to convection currents.</p>
<ol>
<li>Major Plates</li>
<li>Pacific Plate</li>
<li>North American Plate</li>
<li>South American Plate</li>
<li>African Plate</li>
<li>Eurasian Plate</li>
<li>Indo-Australian Plate</li>
<li>Antarctic Plate</li>
<li>Philippine Plate</li>
<li>Caribbean Plate</li>
<li>Nazca Plate</li>
<li>Cocos Plate</li>
<li>Arabian Plate</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plate Boundaries</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Convergent Boundaries:</strong> Plates move towards each other, causing one to subduct beneath the other. This can form mountain ranges, e.g., the Himalayas.</li>
<li><strong>Divergent Boundaries:</strong> Plates move away from each other, creating mid-ocean ridges, e.g., the boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates.</li>
<li><strong>Transform Fault Boundaries:</strong> Plates slide past each other horizontally, e.g., the San Andreas Fault in California.</li>
<li><strong>CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND MINERALOGY</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crystallography:</strong> The branch of science that studies the external form and internal atomic structure of crystalline structures.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal:</strong> A homogeneous solid bounded by naturally formed plane faces, related to a regular internal arrangement of atoms. The process of forming crystals from liquid, gaseous states, or by precipitation from solution is called crystallization.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrangement of Atoms in Crystals</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Crystals are orderly assemblages of atoms or groups of atoms arranged in a three-dimensional pattern, repeated throughout the crystal. The unit cell is the smallest complete unit of this pattern, and the whole crystal structure can be thought of as unit cells stacked together. The symmetry of this unit determines the external symmetry of the crystal. The arrangement of atoms or ions in the crystal can be shown by the framework of the space lattice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements of Crystal</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interfacial Angles:</strong> The angle between adjacent faces of a crystal. Measured using a contact goniometer.</li>
<li><strong>Crystallographic axes: </strong>Also known as axes of reference. Mathematical relationships exist between the crystal faces. Faces can be referred to three coordinate axes passing through the center of the crystal.</li>
<li><strong>Axial ratio: </strong>The relationship between the lengths of different crystallographic axes in a given crystal.</li>
<li><strong>Crystal face: </strong>External surfaces of a crystal, which may be regular or modified geometrical figures like squares, rectangles, triangles, etc.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symmetry Elements of Crystal</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Symmetry elements help visualize the symmetry of an ordered arrangement in a crystal:</p>
<p>Axis of Symmetry: An imaginary line through the center of a crystal. When the crystal is rotated, similar faces appear at least twice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-fold Symmetry: Two similar faces appear.</li>
<li>Three-fold Symmetry: Three similar faces appear.</li>
<li>Four-fold Symmetry: Four similar faces appear.</li>
<li>Six-fold Symmetry: Six similar faces appear.</li>
<li>Plane of Symmetry: An imaginary line dividing the crystal into two symmetrical halves, each being a mirror image of the other.</li>
<li>Center of Symmetry: The midpoint of the line joining two identical points on opposite faces of the crystal.</li>
<li><strong>Crystal form</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A form consists of a group of crystal faces with the same relation to the symmetry elements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pedion: </strong>Single face.</li>
<li><strong>Pinacoid: </strong>Two parallel faces on opposite sides.</li>
<li><strong>Prism</strong>: Three or more non-parallel faces symmetrical about an axis.</li>

<li><strong>Dipyramid: </strong>Combination of two pyramids.</li>
<li><strong>Scalenohedron: </strong>Faces with scalene triangle geometry.</li>
<li><strong>Rhombohedron: </strong>Faces with rhombus geometry.</li>
</ol>
<ul>

<li><strong>Prismatic: </strong>Elongated in one direction, e.g., Feldspars.</li>
<li><strong>Reticulated:</strong> Cross-mesh pattern.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crystal Systems</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Crystals are classified into seven systems based on their symmetry elements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Isometric (cubic) system: </strong>All sides equal, all angles 90&deg;, e.g., Galena, Garnet.</li>
<li><strong>Tetragonal System:</strong> Two horizontal axes equal, vertical axis unequal, all angles 90&deg;, e.g., Chalcopyrite.</li>
<li><strong>Orthorhombic System:</strong> All axes unequal, all angles 90&deg;, e.g., Barytes, Aragonite.</li>
<li><strong>Hexagonal System:</strong> Four axes, three equal horizontal axes intersecting at 60&deg;, one vertical axis unequal, e.g., Quartz, Calcite.</li>
<li><strong>Trigonal System:</strong> Similar to hexagonal but with different symmetry, e.g., Quartz, Calcite.</li>
<li><strong>Monoclinic System:</strong> All axes unequal, two angles 90&deg;, one angle not 90&deg;, e.g., Feldspar, Gypsum.</li>
<li><strong>Triclinic System:</strong> All axes unequal, all angles not 90&deg;, e.g., Kyanite, Turquoise.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mineralogy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mineralogy is the branch of geological science that deals with the study of various aspects of minerals, including their origin, properties, composition, and classification.</p>
<p><strong>Minerals:</strong> Naturally occurring inorganic substances with a definite chemical composition in a crystalline state.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Structural Geology</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Earth&rsquo;s crust is constantly subjected to forces that distort the rocks within a region. These forces can arise from the weight of overlying rocks, large-scale movements of materials, and gravity. Depending on the magnitude and duration of these forces, rocks may undergo temporary or permanent deformation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Structural Geology</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Structural geology is the study of the mechanisms and types of deformation of rocks in the Earth&rsquo;s crust due to stress from various geological processes. It involves understanding the three-dimensional distribution of rock units and their deformation histories. The primary goal is to use present-day rock geometry to infer the history of rock deformation. This field is crucial for assessing the stability of engineering structures like dams, tunnels, and bridges.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rock Deformations &amp; Reasons</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rock Deformations:</strong> Rock deformations occur due to various geological processes such as tectonic activities, earthquakes, and volcanism. These processes cause stress that displaces and distorts rocks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The study of rock deformations focuses on:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Analysis of stress</li>
<li>Analysis of deformations</li>
<li>Response of rocks to stress</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Strain</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dilation:</strong> Change in volume of rock mass.</li>
<li><strong>Distortion:</strong> Change in volume and form of rock mass.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reasons for Rock Deformations</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stress:</strong> Defined as force per unit area, stress is a primary factor in rock deformation. It results from plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanic actions, and other geological processes.</li>
<li>Temperature Changes</li>
<li>Wetting and Drying</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Stress</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compressive Stress:</strong> Acts towards a common point, causing rocks to squeeze and shorten, leading to faulting and folding. Seen along convergent plate boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>Tensile Stress:</strong> Acts away from a common point, causing rocks to elongate and stretch, leading to tensional faults and thinning. Seen along divergent plate boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>Shear Stress:</strong> Acts tangentially along opposite surfaces, causing rocks to repel and push in opposite directions. Seen along transform plate boundaries.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stages of Deformation</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Elastic Deformation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Rocks return to their original shape after the stress is removed.</li>
<li>If stress exceeds the elastic limit, plastic deformation occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Brittle Deformation</strong></li>
<li>Rocks rupture when stress is applied.</li>
<li>Results in geological structures like joints and faults.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Common in brittle rocks like granite.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Ductile Deformation</strong></li>
<li>Rocks undergo significant plastic deformation before rupturing.</li>
<li>Results in geological structures like folds.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Common in rocks like rock salt.</li>
<li><strong>Attitude of Geological Structures: Dip, Strike, Trend, Plunge</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Beds and Bedding</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Beds:</strong> Layers of sedimentary rocks with planar top and bottom surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Bedding:</strong> Planar surfaces of beds, often planes of weakness.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foliation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Planes of separation of mineral layers in metamorphic rocks.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attitude Descriptions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strike:</strong> The direction of the line formed by the intersection of a bedding plane with a horizontal plane.</p>
<p><strong>Dip:</strong> The angle between the bedding plane and the horizontal plane, measured in two components:</p>
<p><strong>Dip Direction:</strong> The direction towards which the beds are inclined.</p>
<p><strong>Dip Amount:</strong> The acute angle between the bedding plane and the horizontal plane.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classification of Dips</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>True Dip:</strong> Perpendicular to the strike, showing the direction of maximum inclination.</li>
<li><strong>Apparent Dip:</strong> Any dip not perpendicular to the strike.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship Between True Dip and Apparent Dip</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship can be expressed as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dip Direction and Dip Amount:</strong> In engineering, these are crucial for slope stability analysis. If the dip direction is known, the strike can be calculated as it is perpendicular to the dip direction. However, if only the strike is known, the dip direction could be either +90&deg; or -90&deg; from the strike.</li>
<li><strong>Plunge and Trend</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plunge:</strong> The vertical angle between an inclined linear feature and an imaginary horizontal plane.</p>
<p><strong>Trend:</strong> The compass direction in which a linear geological feature plunges. Trend and dip direction are similar but used for different features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measurement of Geological Strata Orientations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attitude Determination:</strong> Refers to the strike, dip, and dip direction of a rock bed.</p>
<p><strong>Strike Line:</strong> Joins two points of equal elevation on a bedding plane.</p>
<p><strong>Dip Direction:</strong> Determined by drawing a line perpendicular to the strike line, from higher to lower elevation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dip Amount Calculation:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Measure the horizontal distance (XY) between two strike lines.</p>
<p>Calculate the dip angle using the formula:</p>

<p><strong>Mural Joints:</strong> Occur in massive igneous rocks, forming cubical blocks due to three sets of perpendicular joints.</p>
<p><strong>Columnar Joints:</strong> Found in volcanic igneous rocks like basalt, forming hexagonal prismatic columns.</p>
<p><strong>Sheet Joints:</strong> Found in massive igneous rocks, appearing as sedimentary strata.</p>
<p><strong>Tension Joints:</strong> Developed due to tensile forces, common in folded sequences and igneous rocks.</p>

<p><strong>Shear Joints:</strong> Developed due to shearing forces, found near fault planes and shear zones.</p>
<p>Spatial Relationship Basis</p>
<p><strong>Regular Joints:</strong> Occur in parallel or sub-parallel sets, repeated at regular intervals (e.g., columnar joints, mural joints).</p>
<p><strong>Irregular Joints:</strong> Occur randomly, without regularity in occurrence and distribution, often with curved and rough surfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Causes of Joints</strong></li>

<li><strong>Unconformities</strong></li>

<li><strong>Conformity:</strong> Continuous formation of rock beds without major breaks.</li>
<li><strong>Unconformity:</strong> A depositional gap or break between two conformable sequences, representing a significant break in the geologic record.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Unconformities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parallel Unconformity (Disconformity):</strong> Bedding above and below the unconformity surface are parallel.</p>
<p><strong>Angular Unconformity:</strong> Bedding beneath the unconformity surface is folded or tilted, creating an angular relationship with the younger rocks above.</p>

<li><strong>Fault Identification</strong></li>
<li><strong>Direct Evidence:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Slicken Sides:</strong> Parallel grooves formed due to frictional sliding.</p>
<p><strong>Breccia:</strong> Angular, unconsolidated rock fragments found on either side of a fault plane.</p>

<li><strong>Physiographic Features</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Different types of physiographic features reflect the presence of faulting. One such feature is sudden topographic variation, where there is a sudden drop in topography due to a fault, although the fault may not be visible on the surface due to overlying sediments.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><strong>Mineralization:</strong> High stresses in faults result in intense pressure and temperature, leading to the formation of high P/T minerals like kyanite and sillimanite, commonly seen along the MCT zone. Garnet in the schist of Raduwa is another example.</p>

<li>Sharp contrast in color between rocks.</li>
<li>Intrusive contact.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineering Significances of Geological Structures</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Folds: </strong>Special considerations must be taken during construction on folded masses due to their high strain zones:</li>
<li><strong>Dams:</strong> The flank dipping towards downstream is unfavorable, while the one dipping upstream is safer.</li>
<li><strong>Tunneling:</strong> In synclines, stress is exerted more on the sides than on the crown. In anticlines, tensional fractures may develop on the crown, causing overbreak.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Groundwater:</strong> Synclinal aquifers have higher groundwater potential, while anticlinal conditions are less favorable.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rupture Risk:</strong> Folded areas may rupture due to further stress.</li>
<li><strong>Faults: </strong>Faulted areas are generally unsafe and unstable for civil engineering foundations due to various hazardous effects:</li>
<li><strong>Fractures:</strong> Faults cause considerable rock fractures, making the ground weak and unfit for foundations.</li>
<li><strong>Groundwater:</strong> Fractures act as channels for groundwater, causing problems in tunnels and reservoirs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earthquakes:</strong> Faults are often accompanied by earthquakes, which can cause severe shaking and collapse of infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Landslides:</strong> If the dip direction of the fault plane and surface slope are the same, landslides may occur.</li>
<li><strong>Recurrence:</strong> Fault planes may recur at the same place, making the ground unstable.</li>
<li><strong>Joints: </strong>Joints are considered sources of weakness in rocks, less harmful than faults but more harmful than bedding:</li>
<li><strong>Strength Reduction:</strong> Joints reduce the strength of rocks, especially when saturated with water, causing decay and weathering.</li>
<li><strong>Tunneling:</strong> Intensively jointed rocks can cause overbreak and roof collapse in tunnels.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leakage:</strong> Joints can cause leakage problems in reservoirs and groundwater issues in tunnels.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Landslides:</strong> Similar to faults, the same dipping of joint planes and surface slope can cause landslides and slope failures.</li>

<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Physical geology is the branch of geology that deals with the Earth&rsquo;s composition and the physical changes occurring on it. It involves the study of rocks, minerals, and sediments, their structures and formations, and their processes of origin and alteration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different Geological Agents</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The geological agents responsible for changes on Earth&rsquo;s surface include running water, glaciers, groundwater, wind, and sea water. These topics will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geomorphological Processes: Weathering &amp; Erosion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weathering: </strong>Weathering is the mechanical and chemical decomposition of preexisting rocks into fragments, making minerals separable and movable due to atmospheric conditions. It involves two main processes: mechanical and chemical weathering.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Weathering:</strong> Breaks down rocks without changing their chemical nature. Examples include freezing and thawing of water, pressure release, salt crystal formation, plant root growth, and physical effects of water, ice, wind, and temperature changes.</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Weathering:</strong> Involves chemical changes to minerals that become unstable when exposed to surface conditions. It is most effective in warm, wet climates.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanical Weathering:</strong> Physical forces break down rocks without changing their chemical composition.</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Weathering:</strong> Atmospheric or biologically prepared chemicals cause chemical changes in minerals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Erosion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Erosion is the process of weathering and transporting solids (sediment, soil, rock, and other particles) from their source to other locations. The main agents of erosion are wind and running water, with minor agents including glaciers, ice, and gravity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geological Cycle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The geological cycle involves the continuous process where hot molten materials form igneous rocks, which are then broken down by weathering to create soil and sedimentary rocks. This cycle includes the hydrologic cycle, rock cycle, and tectonic cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geological Agents</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Running Water</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Running water, such as streams and rivers, moves from high to low gradients, carrying and depositing materials along the way. River channel morphology refers to the channel pattern and geometry at various points along a river.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Straight Rivers:</strong> Follow a straight path, typically found in steep topography with high flow velocity and high erosion rates.</li>
<li><strong>Meandering Rivers:</strong> Follow a zigzag path, found in areas with moderate relief and gradient, with balanced erosion and deposition rates.</li>
<li><strong>Braided Rivers:</strong> Have multiple paths that may converge, found in low-gradient areas with high sediment deposition rates.</li>

<li><strong>Volcanism</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. Earth&rsquo;s volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major rigid tectonic plates. Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of Earth through a vent. It includes all the phenomena that cause magma to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface.</p>

<li><strong>Introduction To The Physiography &amp; Tectonic Division Of Nepal Himalaya</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to 40 million years ago, there was a sea called Tethys between the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau. The Indian subcontinent gradually moved towards the Tibetan plate, and around 40 million years ago, they came into contact, causing the Tethys Sea to disappear. The Indian continental crust, being lighter, could not sink into the mantle and remained beneath the Tibetan continental crust.</p>
<p>The Himalayas were formed about 2 million years ago due to the collision of rock masses from the north and south and are still rising at a rate of 2-5 mm per year. The Himalayan range extends about 2400 km from the Indus Valley in the west to Assam in the east. The collision caused the northern margin of the Indian continent to shorten and slice into three principal thrusts: the Main Central Thrust (MCT), the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT), and the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on these faults and thrusts, nepal himalaya can be divided into five major tectonic zones:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Terai Zone</li>
<li>Siwalik Zone</li>
<li>Lesser Himalaya Zone</li>
<li>Higher Himalaya Zone</li>
<li>Tibetan Tethys Zone</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major Discontinuities System of Nepal Himalaya</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Himalaya/Main Frontal Thrust (Hft/Mft)</strong></li>
<li>Located at the boundary of the Siwalik and Terai.</li>
<li>Considered active with a maximum earthquake potential of magnitude 6.5.</li>
<li>North dipping fault.</li>
<li><strong>Main Boundary Thrust (MBT)</strong></li>
<li>Located at the boundary of Lesser Himalayas and Siwalik.</li>
<li>Considered active with earthquakes up to magnitude 8.</li>
<li>Steep north dipping fault.</li>
<li><strong>Main Central Thrust (MCT)</strong></li>
<li>Located at the boundary of Higher Himalaya and Lesser Himalaya.</li>
<li>Less active now but was active during early phases of Himalaya formation.</li>
<li>Earthquakes up to magnitude 7.5.</li>
<li>North dipping fault.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineering Significances of Discontinuities</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Thrust zones are prone to landslides, rock falls, debris flows, and mudflows.</li>
<li>Thrusts influence the movement of surface water and can cause sudden changes in river courses, affecting underground water.</li>
<li>Thrust zones are porous, weak, unstable, and incompetent, raising concerns about the stability of engineering structures.</li>
<li>Active thrusts near engineering sites are vulnerable to earthquakes and should be avoided for heavy construction.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Northern (Bhabar) Region:</strong> Composed of thick beds of pebbles and boulders, acts as a recharge zone for groundwater.</li>
<li><strong>Middle (Marshy) Region:</strong> Flat, marshy land with gravel beds, sand horizons, and clay layers.</li>
<li><strong>Southern Region:</strong> Composed of finer sediments like clays, silts, and fine sands.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Lower Siwalik:</strong> Fine-grained sandstone, mudstone, siltstone, and shale.</li>
<li><strong>Middle Siwalik:</strong> Medium-grained, thick sandstones with biotite, quartz, and feldspar.</li>
<li><strong>Upper Siwalik:</strong> Very coarse-grained rocks such as boulders and conglomerates.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geology of Lesser Himalaya Zone</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Bordered by MBT to the south and MCT to the north.</li>
<li>Width: 60-80 km.</li>
<li>Composed mostly of unfossiliferous metasedimentary and metamorphic rocks like shale, sandstone, limestone, dolomite, slate, phyllite, schist, marble, and quartzite.</li>
<li>Highly faulted and folded, with complex structures.</li>
<li>Contains magmatic intrusions like granite and pegmatite.</li>

<li><strong>Study of Geological Units: Complex, Group, Formation &amp; Member</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The sequence of rocks is subdivided based on their lithology. From smaller to larger scale, the main units recognized are member, formation, group, and complex/super group. They are described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Formation:</strong></p>
<p>A series of beds distinct from other beds above and below, thick enough to be shown on geological maps.Boundaries between formations are not necessarily sharp.</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A series of formations classified together to define a group.</li>
<li>Can be a few thousand meters thick and represent rocks deposited within a single basin.</li>
<li>May consist of different formations in different geographical areas, and individual formations may appear in more than one group.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Members:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In areas where detailed geological information is needed (e.g., mining or petroleum districts), a formation might be divided into members, each with a specific and distinct lithology.</li>
<li>For example, a formation that includes both shale and sandstone might be divided into members, each of which is either shale or limestone.a</li>
