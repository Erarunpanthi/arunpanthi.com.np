In a hydropower plant, water isdirected to move turbines, which in turn run electric generators. The potential energy of water stored in a dam is firstconverted into the kinetic energy of flowing water in the penstock, and then into electrical energy via the turbine–generatorcombination.</p>    </section><!-- Section 2: Power & Energy Conversion -->    <section id="power-energy"><h2>Power & Energy Conversion</h2><p>The power output of a hydropower system can be calculated using the formula:</p><p><em>P = ρ<sub>w</sub> × g × Q × H × n</em> (Watts)</p><ul><li><strong>ρ<sub>w</sub></strong> – Density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>)</li><li><strong>g</strong> – Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>)</li><li><strong>Q</strong> – Flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/s)</li><li><strong>H</strong> – Effective head or height difference (m)</li><li><strong>n</strong> – Overall efficiency of the turbine–generator set</li></ul><p>Energy is defined as the total power consumed over a period and is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Key factors include:</p><ul><li>  <strong>Annual Runoff:</strong> Approximately 175 billion cubic meters within Nepalese territory, rising to around 200 billion cubic meters when the Tibetan drainage is included.</li><li>  <strong>Topography:</strong> Ranges from the highest peaks (8848 m) to valleys below 100 m over a short distance (160–270 km), creating significant elevation differences.</li><li>  <strong>River Network:</strong> More than 6,000 rivers and rivulets cross the country.</li><li>  <strong>Average Annual Precipitation:</strong> About 1500 mm.</li></ul>    <h3>Potential Estimates</h3><p>Nepal’s hydropower potential can be categorized into three types:</p><ul><li>  <strong>Gross (Theoretical) Potential:</strong> This is the total theoretical capacity based solely on the physical availability of water and topography, estimated at approximately <strong>83,000 MW</strong>.</li><li>  <strong>Technically Feasible Potential:</strong> This reflects the capacity that can realistically be harnessed using current technology, considering environmental and engineering constraints. Although exact figures vary, advances in technology make a large portion of the gross potential achievable.</li><li>  <strong>Economically Feasible Potential:</strong> Once economic, market, and infrastructure constraints are applied, the viable potential for development is around <strong>42,000 MW</strong>.</li></ul>    <h3>Nepali Major River Basin Potential</h3><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><thead>  <tr>    <th>River Basin</th>    <th>Potential (MW)</th>  </tr></thead><tbody>  <tr>    <td>Kosi</td>    <td>22,350</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Gandaki</td>    <td>20,650</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Karnali</td>    <td>32,010</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Mahakali</td>    <td>4,160</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Southern Rivers</td>    <td>4,110</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><strong>Total</strong></td>    <td><strong>83,280</strong></td>  </tr></tbody></table>    <h2>Classification Based on Operation</h2><ul><li>  <strong>Isolated Plant:</strong> e.g. Micro hydropowers.</li><li>  <strong>Grid Connected:</strong> In Nepal, the Independent National Power System (INPS) connects all projects. The grid is owned by NEA and operated through a load center at Swichatar, Kathmandu.</li></ul><h2>Classification Based on Storage capacity</h2><h3>Run-of-River Hydropower</h3><p>In run-of-river plants, electricity is generated as and when water flows in the river. When the river dries up or the flow falls below a certain predetermined minimum (i.e. the minimum flow required for the turbine), electricity generation stops.</p><p>Due to the large variation in river flow in Nepal, these projects are normally designed for the dry season flows. They are suitable for perennial rivers that have adequate discharge throughout the year. The minimum dry flow must be sufficient to run the turbine efficiently and economically.</p><p>For example: Bhotekoshi Hydroelectric Plant (36 MW), Indrawati-III (7.5 MW), Modi Hydropower Plant (14 MW), etc.</p><h3>Examples</h3><ol><li>  <strong>Kulekhani II:</strong> 2 × 16 MW, Francis Turbine, commissioned in 1986.</li><li>  <strong>Kulekhani III:</strong> 2 × 7 MW, Francis Turbine, commissioned in 2019.</li><li>  <strong>Upper Trishuli 3A Hydropower Station (60 MW):</strong> 2 units each of 30 MW; located in Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts; commissioned in 2019.</li><li>  <strong>Trishuli Hydropower Station (24 MW):</strong> 6 units each of 3.5 MW and 1 unit of 3 MW; commissioned in 196?

Most rivers in Nepal show significant variations between the rainy (monsoon) season and the dry season. This variation often causes low power generation during the dry season when using run-of-river schemes.</p><p>To mitigate this, excess water during the rainy season is stored by constructing a dam and reservoir. This stored water can be used to generate electricity during the dry season (winter). Large dams can store several years’ worth of water and may be built in non-perennial rivers. In addition, the powerhouse may be located at the toe of the dam or separated from it.</p><p><strong>For example:</strong> Kulekhani-I (60 MW) and Budhigand Hydroelectric Plant (650 MW) demonstrate the storage hydropower approach.</p><p><strong>Kulekhani-I Hydropower Station (60 MW):</strong> Located in Makwanpur district, it features 2 units. The project uses a Rock Fill Earthen Dam with a height of 114 m and a total reservoir capacity of 85,300,000 m³, and is equipped with Pelton turbines.</p>    </section>    <!-- Pump Storage Plants -->    <section id="pump-storage-plants"><h2>Pump Storage Plants</h2><p>Unlike conventional hydropower plants, pump storage plants reuse water. After water produces electricity by flowing through turbines, it is discharged into a lower reservoir located beneath the dam. During off-peak hours (when energy demand is low), some of this water is pumped into an upper reservoir. Later, during periods of peak demand, the stored water is released to generate additional electricity.</p><p>Pump storage plants generate power only during peak hours, providing extra capacity to meet high demand. However, these systems are comparatively expensive.</p><h2>Methods of Fixing Installed Capacity of a Plant</h2><ol><li>  <strong>Marginal Cost and Benefit Approach:</strong>  <p>    Total Marginal Cost = Annual cost of installed electromechanical equipment (AC) + additional costs (e.g., O&M costs).  </p>  <p>    Marginal Benefit = Total energy generated × energy rate.  </p></li><li>  <strong>Installed Capacity Optimization Approach:</strong>  <p>    Determine the power corresponding to different percentage levels of time available discharge (from Q25 to Q75) and trade off between cost and revenue to achieve optimum benefit.  </p></li></ol>    </section>    <!-- History of Power Sector Development in Nepal -->    <section id="history-power-sector"><h2>History of Power Sector Development in Nepal</h2>    <h3>Early Developments</h3><ul><li>  <strong>Farping (500 kW):</strong> A model project in Asia (investment: 7 lakhs; duration: 17 months), commissioned in 1911 AD.</li><li>  <strong>Sundarijal (640 kW):</strong> Achieved before World War II (1936 AD); used for water supply in the Kathmandu Valley after discharge from a tailrace.</li><li>  <strong>Morang Hydropower Company (MHC):</strong> Established during the tenure of Sri 3 Juddha Samser under the planning of Bijay Samser with Padma Sundar Malla as the Chief Engineer, in 1939 AD.</li><li>  <strong>Letang HPP (1800 kW):</strong> Constructed by MHC, mainly supplying the Biratnagar Jute Mill; commissioned in 1942 AD.

Over time, sediments carried by inflowing water settle within the reservoir, reducing its effective storage capacity and potentially affecting operational efficiency.</p>    <h2>Types of Loading</h2><p>Sediment loading occurs in various forms, primarily characterized by the size and mode of transport of the sediment particles:</p><ul><li>  <strong>Bed Load:</strong> Coarser sediments that move along the reservoir  bed due to rolling or sliding.</li><li>  <strong>Suspended Load:</strong> Finer particles that remain in the water  column and settle slowly.</li><li>  <strong>Wash Load:</strong> Very fine sediments that stay almost entirely in  suspension and are generally transported out of the reservoir.</li></ul>  <h2>Factors Affecting Sedimentation</h2><p>Several factors influence the rate and extent of sediment deposition in areservoir:</p><ul><li>  <strong>Inflow Velocity:</strong> Higher velocities keep sediments in  suspension longer, reducing the rate of deposition.</li><li>  <strong>Watershed Characteristics:</strong> The terrain, soil type, land  use, and land cover determine the amount of sediment that reaches the  reservoir.</li><li>  <strong>Reservoir Geometry:</strong> The shape, area, and depth affect how  and where sediments settle.</li><li>  <strong>Seasonal Variations:</strong> Seasonal changes in rainfall and  runoff patterns lead to episodically high sediment loads.</li><li>  <strong>Human Activity:</strong> Deforestation, agriculture, and  construction practices can accelerate erosion and increase sediment  inflow.</li></ul><h2>Sediment Control in Reservoirs</h2><p>To mitigate the adverse effects of sediment deposition and extend thereservoir’s life, various control measures are implemented:</p><ul><li>  <strong>Dredging:</strong> Mechanical removal of accumulated sediments to  restore storage capacity.</li><li>  <strong>Flush Operations:</strong> Scheduled water releases which help  mobilize and expel accumulated sediments downstream.</li><li>  <strong>Sediment Bypass Tunnels:</strong> Infrastructure designed to divert  sediment-laden water away from the reservoir.</li><li>  <strong>Watershed Management:</strong> Land use practices such as reforestation  and soil conservation to reduce sediment inflow.</li><li>  <strong>Design Modifications:</strong> Incorporation of sediment traps and  erosion-control measures in dam design.</li></ul><h2>Life of a Reservoir</h2><p>The useful life of a reservoir is largely determined by the rate of sedimentaccumulation. As sediments deposit over time, the effective storage capacitydiminishes, which may necessitate interventions such as dredging or othersediment management strategies to prolong the reservoir’s operational life.</p><h2>Sediment Yield and Reservoir Trap Efficiency</h2><p><strong>Sediment Yield</strong> refers to the amount of sediment carriedby the inflowing water from the watershed, typically measured in tons peryear. The <strong>Trap Efficiency</strong> of a reservoir is the ratio ofthe sediment that the reservoir retains compared to the total sedimentinflow.</p><p>The following table summarizes these key parameters:</p><table><thead>  <tr>    <th>Parameter</th>    <th>Description</th>  </tr></thead><tbody>  <tr>    <td>Sediment Yield</td>    <td>Quantity of sediment supplied by the catchment area (tons/year)</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Trap Efficiency</td>    <td>Percentage of incoming sediment that is retained within the reservoir</td>  </tr></tbody></table><h2>Capacity Inflow Ratio</h2><p>The capacity inflow ratio is a critical metric for evaluating thesusceptibility of a reservoir to sedimentation. It is determined by comparingthe reservoir’s total storage capacity with the annual volume of water inflow.</p><ul><li>  A <strong>low capacity inflow ratio</strong> indicates that even a small  increase in sediment yield could significantly reduce the reservoir's  capacity.</li><li>  A <strong>high capacity inflow ratio</strong> suggests greater resilience  to sediment accumulation as the reservoir can accommodate more sediment  before a notable reduction in storage capacity occurs.</li></ul>    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/16966154"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div></section></div> <!--------------------------------Components of Hydropower Plant-------------------------------------------->    <div class="container"><section id="Components of Hydropower Plant"> <h1>Hydropower Plant Components </h1>  <p>    This page presents the complete process of a hydropower project—from diverting the river water to the discharge back into the river.

The stored water on its upstream side serves various purposes such as:  </p>  <ul>    <li>Flood Mitigation</li>    <li>Irrigation</li>    <li>Water Supply</li>    <li>Navigation</li>    <li>Fishery and Wildlife Preservation</li>    <li>Hydro-electric Power Generation</li>    <li>Recreation</li>  </ul>  <!-- Section: Types of Dam -->  <h2>Types of Dam</h2>  <h3>A. Classification as per Function and Use</h3>  <ol>    <li><strong>Storage Dam</strong>: Normally constructed to store excess flood water for various purposes such as irrigation, water supply, and hydropower. It may be made of concrete, earth, or rockfill (e.g., Kulekhani-1).    </li>    <li><strong>Detention Dam</strong>: Mainly constructed to control floods. A detention dam safeguards against possible flood damage on the downstream side. (No such dam in Nepal till date.)    </li>    <li><strong>Diversion Dam</strong>: Used to divert river water into canals, conduits, or other streams. Typically a weir or low-level dam is constructed to raise the water level for diversion (e.g., Bheri-Babai Diversion, Sunkoshi Marine Diversion).    </li>    <li><strong>Debris or Check Dam</strong>: A low-height dam constructed across a stream channel to conserve soil and retain sand, gravel, driftwood, or other debris.    </li>    <li><strong>Coffer Dam</strong>: A temporary dam constructed to isolate the construction area from river flow during dam building.    </li>  </ol>  <h3>B. Classification as per Hydraulic Design</h3>  <ol>    <li><strong>Overflow Dam</strong>: Built to allow the overflow of surplus water above its top. Only a few meters of its length act as the overflow section (e.g., Rigid Dam).    </li>    <li><strong>Non-Overflow Dam</strong>: Designed so that water is not allowed to overtop the dam (e.g., Earth dam, rockfill dam, Kulekhani-1 dam).    </li>  </ol>  <h3>C. Classification as per Structural Design</h3>  <ol>    <li><strong>Gravity Dam</strong>: A solid concrete or masonry dam that resists external forces through its own weight.    </li>    <li><strong>Arch Dam</strong>: A curved masonry or concrete dam with the convex side facing upstream. It resists a major portion of water pressure through arch action and generally has less self-weight than a gravity dam.    </li>    <li><strong>Buttress Dam</strong>: Consists of an upstream sloping deck supported by several buttresses or piers constructed of reinforced concrete and supported by struts or bracings.    </li>    <li><strong>Embankment Dams</strong>: Constructed from locally available soils, gravel, and sand that resist external forces through their shear strength. They are usually trapezoidal in section (e.g., Earth dam, earth and rock fill dam).    </li>  </ol><ul>    <li><strong>High Dam or Large Dam</strong>: If the height of the dam is greater than 100 m.</li>    <li><strong>Medium Dam</strong>: If the height of the dam is between 50 m and 100 m.</li>    <li><strong>Low Dam or Small Dam</strong>: If the height of the dam is lower than 50 m.</li>  </ul>    <h3>D. Classification as per Material of Construction</h3>  <ul>    <li><strong>Rigid Dams</strong>: Dams made of rigid material (typically concrete).</li>    <li><strong>Non-Rigid Dams</strong>: Dams built of non-rigid materials such as earth, rock fill, etc. Examples include earth dams, embankment dams, and rock fill dams.</li>  </ul>    <h2>Selection of Site for Dam</h2>  <ul>    <li>Foundation</li>    <li>Topography</li>    <li>Reservoir</li>    <li>Catchment Area</li>    <li>Spillway</li>    <li>Construction Material</li>    <li>Communication</li>    <li>Environmental Conditions</li>  </ul> <h2>Design of Dam</h2>  <h3>Forces Acting on a Gravity Dam</h3>  <ul>    <li><strong>Uplift Pressure:</strong> Due to water percolation under the dam.    </li>    <li><strong>Effect of Vertical Acceleration (<em>a<sub>v</sub></em>):</strong><p>When vertical acceleration occurs, inertia forces act on the water.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><pre>F = (W/g) x a<sub>v</sub> g = W x a<sub>v</sub></pre><p>The inertia force acts opposite to the direction of acceleration. When the acceleration is downward, the inertia force acts upward (reducing the dam's effective weight), and when the acceleration is upward, it acts downward (increasing the effective weight). Hence, the modified weight of the dam is:</p><p><strong>Modified weight:</strong> W′ = W(1 ± a<sub>v</sub>)</p>    </li>    <li><strong>Wave Pressure:</strong><p>Blowing winds generate waves on the reservoir surface that produce pressure toward the downstream side. The wave pressure depends on the height of the waves.</p><p><strong>Wave Height Equations:</strong></p><pre>hw = 0.032WT + 0.763 - 0.271 km   hw = 0.032(TV for F > 32 km)</pre><p>Where:<br>hw = height of water from crest to trough (in metres),<br>V = wind velocity (in km/hr),<br>F = fetch (length of water expanse in km).</p><p>The maximum pressure intensity due to wave action is given by:</p><pre>pw = 2.4 x hw</pre><p>This pressure acts at (5hw/6) metres above the still water surface with a triangular distribution.</p>    </li>    <li><strong>Ice Pressure:</strong><p>In cold countries, ice formed on the reservoir may expand upon melting, causing a thrust on the dam’s face. This force acts linearly along the dam at the reservoir level. Its magnitude can vary from 250 to 1500 kN/m, with an average allowable value of around 500 kN/m².</p>    </li> <h4>Sliding Basis</h4>  <p>    To ensure safety against sliding, the frictional resistance μ(W – U) must be equal to or greater than the horizontal forces. Various forms of this relationship using parameters such as g, H, B, and other coefficients are provided.  </p>  <pre>μ(W - U) = P,   or,   g(W - U) = pK H B²   or   g B (G - K)²H,   or   B ≈ H / √[g(G - K)]  </pre>  </ul>    <h3>Design of Earthen Dams</h3>  <h4>General Considerations</h4>  <p>    Earthen dams are typically more economical due to the use of local materials and unskilled labor. They can be constructed on relatively poor foundations with modern techniques like compaction, grouting, and foundation improvement. Continuous field observation and monitoring for deformation and pore water pressures are necessary during construction for any required modifications.  </p>  <h4>Demerits</h4>  <ul>    <li>Risk of damage or destruction due to overtopping.</li>    <li>Potential for internal erosion of the dam or its foundation.</li>    <li>High maintenance cost.</li>    <li>Not suitable for very wet climates.</li>  </ul>  <h4>Common Causes of Earthen Dam Failures</h4>  <ul>    <li><strong>Overtopping:</strong> Occurs when the free board or spillway capacity is insufficient.    </li>    <li><strong>Erosion of the Downstream Toe:</strong> Caused by heavy cross-currents from spillway buckets or tail water. This can be mitigated by providing an appropriately pitched downstream slope or riprap protection.    </li>    <li><strong>Erosion of the Upstream Surface:</strong> Waves at the water’s surface may erode the upstream face and cause slippage. Protective measures include stone pitching or riprap.    </li>    <li><strong>Seepage Failure:</strong> Uncontrolled seepage through the dam body or foundation may lead to failure. This includes:<ul><li>  <strong>Piping through the dam body:</strong> Seepage initiating through weak soils, forming channels that transport material downstream.</li><li>  <strong>Piping through the foundation:</strong> Occurring when permeable cavities or layers (of gravel or coarse sand) in the foundation lead to heavy seepage and erosion.</li><li>  <strong>Sloughing of the downstream side:</strong> Saturation at the downstream toe can cause erosion and a subsequent slump or slide.</li></ul>    </li>  </ul>  <h4>Design Criteria for Earthen Dams</h4>  <ul>    <li><strong>Top Width:</strong><ul><li>The top width should be a minimum of 3 m (often governed by roadway requirements).</li><li>  Thumb rules:  <ul>    <li>For very low dams: W = H/5 + 3</li>    <li>For dams lower than 30 m: W = H/5</li>    <li>For dams higher than 30 m: W = 1.65(H + 1.5)<sup>1/3</sup></li>  </ul></li></ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Free Board:</strong> Typically 1.5 × hw.    </li>    <li>The phreatic (seepage) line must remain within the downstream face of the dam to prevent sloughing.    </li>    <li>Both upstream and downstream slopes should be protected using riprap, berms, or grass to withstand wave, rain, and erosive impacts.    </li>    <li>Adequate spillway and outlet capacities are required to avoid overtopping during the design flood.    </li>  </ul>  <h4>Prevention of Seepage through the Embankment</h4>  <ul>    <li><strong>Horizontal Drainage Filter:</strong> Provide a filter with a length L = 3H or 25–100% of the horizontal distance from the centre of the top width to the toe.    </li>    <li><strong>Filter Drainage:</strong> An inclined filter towards the toe, with a height of 25–30% of the dam height.    </li>    <li><strong>Chimney Drains:</strong> Extend upward into the embankment for effective drainage.    </li>  </ul>  <h2>Modes of Failure and Stability Analysis</h2>  <ol>    <li><strong>Overturning (Rotation) about the Toe</strong>: If the resultant of all the forces acting on a dam at any section passes outside the toe, the dam will tend to rotate and overturn about the toe. The ratio of the righting moments (anti-clockwise) to the overturning moments (clockwise) is called the factor of safety against overturning; a value generally greater than 1.5 is desirable.    </li>    <li><strong>Compression or Crushing</strong>: A dam may fail when the compressive stresses exceed the allowable stresses of the construction material. The vertical stress distribution at the base is given by the equation: <br><em>p = Direct Stress + Bending Stress</em>.Masonry and concrete gravity dams are designed so that no tension develops; however, under severe loading conditions, a limited amount of tensile stress (around 5 MN/m<sup>2</sup> under worst-case conditions) may be allowed. Tension cracks (for example, at the heel) may reduce the effective width of the base, shift the resultant force towards the toe, and lead to increased compressive stress and potential failure.    </li>    <li><strong>Sliding (Shear Failure)</strong>: Sliding occurs when the net horizontal force (external forces) exceeds the frictional resistance along any potential sliding plane at the dam or its base. The frictional resistance is given by the product of the normal force and the coefficient of friction. A factor of safety against sliding (F.S.S.) greater than unity is required.    </li>  </ol>    <h2>Foundation Treatment for Gravity Dams</h2>  <h3>Preparing the Surface</h3>  <p>    The entire loose soil is removed until a sound bedrock is exposed. The final surface is then stepped to increase frictional resistance against sliding. In addition, a shear key might be provided.  </p>    <h3>Grouting the Foundation</h3>  <p>    Foundation grouting is divided into two parts:  </p>  <ol>    <li><strong>Consolidation Grouting</strong>: Shallow holes (called B holes) are drilled through the foundation rock, normally between 10 to 15 m deep and 5 to 20 m apart near the heel. A mixture of cement and water (grout) is forced into these holes at low pressure (about 30 to 40 N/cm<sup>2</sup>) prior to any concreting. This consolidates the foundation and later serves as a cutoff when high-pressure cement grouting is employed.    </li>  <li> <strong>Curtain Grouting</strong>: Curtain grouting helps in forming the principal barrier (or curtain) against seepage through the foundation, thereby reducing uplift pressures. To accomplish this high‐pressure grouting, relatively deeper holes (called “A holes”) are drilled near the heel of the dam. The spacing of these holes may vary from 1.2 to 1.5 m. Initially, holes are drilled and grouted at about 10 to 12 m apart, and then the intermediate holes are drilled and grouted.    </p>    <p>The depths of the holes vary from 30 to 40% of the total upstream water head for strong rock foundations, and may be as much as 70% of the water pressure head for poor rock conditions. After drilling, a mixture of cement and water (grout) is forced into the holes under high pressure. The grouting pressure is maintained as high as possible without lifting the foundation strata. Typically, the foundation pressure during high‐pressure grouting is approximately 2.5 D N/cm² (where D is the depth of grouting in metres below the surface).    </p>    <p>Grouting is generally performed in stages (approximately 15 m depth stages) and is carried out only after a portion of the dam section has been laid. This grouting may be accomplished from the foundation gallery, other galleries within the dam, from the upstream face if feasible, or in certain special cases, from tunnels driven into the foundation rock below the dam.    </p></ol>  <!-- Seepage Control in Earth Dam Section -->    <h2>Seepage Control in Earth Dam</h2>    <h3>1. Providing the Drainage Filter (Filter Media)</h3>    <p>To reduce downstream pore water pressure, a drainage filter is provided. This typically involves:    </p>    <ul><li>Rock toe protection</li><li>Horizontal blanket</li><li>Chimney drain</li>    </ul>    <p>A multi-layer filter—commonly referred to as an inverted filter, horizontal blanket, or horizontal filter—is used in these applications.    </p>    <h3>2. Seepage Control Through the Foundation</h3>    <ul><li><strong>Impervious Cutoff:</strong> Concrete or sheet piles may be installed at the upstream end of the earthen dam. A cutoff installed to 50% of the foundation depth reduces discharge by 25%, and to 90% depth, discharge is reduced by 65%.</li><li><strong>Relief Wells and Drain Trenches:</strong> When large-scale seepage occurs through a foundation overlain by a thin layer, there is potential for water to boil up near the dam toe.

To prevent scouring of the downstream bed from the falling water jet, an artificial pool with a concrete apron and a low secondary dam is constructed downstream.    </p>    <h3>Chute Spillway (Trough or Open Channel Spillway)</h3>    <ul><li>Discharges surplus water from upstream to downstream via a steeply sloped open channel.</li><li>Preferred in situations where the river valley is very narrow.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Siphon Spillway</h3>    <ul><li>Discharges surplus water downstream through an inverted U-shaped conduit.</li><li>When the reservoir level rises above the normal pool level, water enters the conduit and discharges by siphonic action.</li>    </ul>    <!-- Energy Dissipation Section -->    <h2>Energy Dissipation</h2>    <p>The energy dissipators for spillways can be grouped into several categories:    </p>    <ul><li>Hydraulic jump stilling basins</li><li>Free pits and trajectory buckets</li><li>Roller buckets</li><li>Oscillation by spatial hydraulic jump (impact type energy dissipators)</li>    </ul>    <h3>Hydraulic Jump Type Stilling Basin</h3>    <p>A stilling basin is provided at the toe of a spillway to dissipate the energy of excess water by forming a hydraulic jump.

When a high-velocity sheet of water slides down the spillway, it is arrested by the tail water.    </p>    <h3>Deflector / Flip / Ski Jump / Trajectory Bucket</h3>    <p>This energy dissipator is used when the tail water depth is insufficient to form a hydraulic jump (i.e., when the tail water depth is much less than the post-jump depth). It is suitable for situations where the foundation rock is strong enough to withstand the erosive impact of the jet. The bucket deflects the high-velocity jet into the air so that it strikes the river bed at a considerable distance, where energy is dissipated through air resistance, viscous effects, and turbulence.    </p>    <h3>Selection of Energy Dissipators</h3>    <ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> When the TW curve coincides with the Y2 curve — this condition is most favorable for jump formation.

This accounts for water that may slip through without doing work.    </p>    <p><strong>Overall Efficiency:</strong> The ratio of the power available at the turbine shaft to the power supplied at the turbine entrance.    </p>    <h3>Turbine Speeds</h3>    <ol><li><strong>Runway Speed:</strong><p>  If the external load on the machine suddenly drops to zero (sudden rejection) and the governing mechanism fails, the turbine races to the maximum possible speed known as the runway speed.</p><table>  <tr>    <th>Turbine Type</th>    <th>Runaway Speed (% of Normal)</th>    <th>Minimum Acceptable Head Variation (% of Design Head)</th>    <th>Maximum Acceptable Head Variation (% of Design Head)</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Impulse</td>    <td>170–190</td>    <td>65</td>    <td>123</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Reaction</td>    <td>(Data not clearly specified)</td>    <td>50</td>    <td>150</td>  </tr></table></li><li><strong>Specific Speed (Ns):</strong><p>  The specific speed of a turbine is defined as the speed of a geometrically similar turbine that would develop unit power under unit head conditions.

This is generally given by the equation:</p><p><em>n = 120f / N</em></p><p>  where n is the turbine’s rotational speed (in rpm), f is the electrical frequency (in Hz, e.g., 50 Hz), and N is the number of generator poles.</p></li><li><strong>Speed Factor or Speed Ratio (φ):</strong><p>  This is the ratio of the peripheral speed of the buckets or vanes at the nominal diameter to the theoretical velocity of water under the effective head acting on the turbine.

It is an airtight diverging conduit whose cross-sectional area increases along its length, connecting the runner exit to the tail race level. Its primary functions include:    </p>    <ul><li>Decreasing the pressure at the runner exit to below atmospheric, thereby increasing the effective head.</li><li>Recovering a portion of the exit kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost in the tail race.</li><li>Fixing the turbine in position above the tail race to ensure proper installation.</li>    </ul><h2>Governing of Hydraulic Turbines</h2>    <ul><li>With a constant generator speed (e.g., N = 120), the turbine speed tends to decrease when the load is increased—and vice versa.</li><li>The governor regulates the amount of water flowing through the turbine in proportion to the load, maintaining nearly constant turbine speed.</li><li>For reaction turbines, the governor controls the guide vanes and wicket gates.</li><li>For impulse turbines, the governor controls devices such as spear valves and nozzle openings.</li>    </ul><h2>Electro-mechanical Installation</h2>    <h3>Generator</h3>    <p>An electric generator is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. Usually, this energy is obtained from a rotating shaft (the armature). The generated electricity is used for power transmission at commercial, industrial, or domestic levels. In most systems, current is supplied at 50 Hz. A generator consists primarily of:    </p>    <ul><li><strong>Stator:</strong> Contains the stationary magnetic poles.</li><li><strong>Rotor:</strong> Contains the rotating armature.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Hydropower Generator</h3>    <p>The hydropower generator is the main equipment used to produce electric energy in a hydropower station. In a “water-to-wire” system, the turbine acts as the prime mover, converting the water power into mechanical energy which is then transformed into electrical power.    </p>    <h3>Types of Hydropower Generators</h3>    <ul><li><strong>Horizontal Type:</strong> Generally used for medium and small capacity units (often driven by Pelton turbines), with maximum speeds up to 1500 rpm.</li><li><strong>Vertical Type:</strong> Common in large and medium units (typically paired with Francis or Kaplan turbines) with maximum speeds reaching up to 750 rpm.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Types of Electrical Generators</h3>    <ul><li><strong>Synchronous Generator:</strong> Equipped with a DC excitation system (rotating or static) and a voltage regulator to manage voltage and phase angle. They can operate in isolation because the excitation is not grid dependent, though these tend to be more expensive.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous Generator:</strong> Typically a squirrel-cage induction motor without voltage regulation capability; its speed is directly linked to the system frequency and it draws excitation current from the grid.</li>    </ul><h2>Pump</h2>    <p>A pump is a device that moves fluids—liquids or gases (or sometimes slurries)—by mechanical action. Pumps operate by mechanisms (typically reciprocating or rotary) and are used to perform mechanical work on a fluid.    </p>    <h3>Classification of Pumps</h3>    <ul><li><strong>Rotodynamic Pumps:</strong> Energy increase is achieved by a combination of centrifugal force, pressure energy, and kinetic energy. These are commonly known as centrifugal pumps.</li><li><strong>Positive Displacement Pumps:</strong> These move fluid by trapping a fixed amount and then forcing (displacing) that trapped volume into the discharge pipe.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Component Parts of a Centrifugal Pump</h3>    <p>A centrifugal pump typically consists of the following parts:    </p>    <ul><li>Suction Pipe/Port</li><li>Casing</li><li>Impeller</li><li>Delivery (Discharge) Pipe</li>    </ul> <h2>Reciprocating Pump</h2><p>A reciprocating pump is a device that moves a fluid by displacing it with a piston or plunger executing a reciprocating motion in a closely fitting cylinder. The amount of liquid pumped equals the volume displaced by the piston.    </p>    <p>Pumps designed with disk pistons can create pressures up to 25 bar, while plunger pumps can generate even higher pressures. The discharge rate from these pumps is almost entirely dependent on the pump speed.    </p>    <p>The overall efficiency of a reciprocating pump is about 0 to 200% higher than that of a comparable centrifugal pump.    </p>    <p>Although reciprocating pumps for industrial applications have become nearly obsolete due to their high capital and maintenance costs compared to centrifugal pumps, small reciprocating pumps (such as cycle pumps, football pumps, village well pumps, and pumps used as hydraulic jacks) still find wide application. This pump type is best suited for relatively small capacities and high heads and is very useful in oil drilling operations.    </p><h2>Main Components and Working of a Reciprocating Pump</h2>    <p>The main parts of a reciprocating pump are:    </p>    <ul><li>Cylinder</li><li>Suction Valve</li><li>Suction Pipe</li><li>Piston</li><li>Delivery Valve</li><li>Delivery Pipe</li><li>Connecting mechanism operated by a power source such as a steam engine, diesel engine, or an electric motor.</li>
