            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The history of road development in Nepal is <strong>relatively short</strong>.</li>
                <li>The first motorable road was constructed in the <strong>Kathmandu Valley in 1924</strong>.</li>
                <li>By the <strong>1950s</strong>, Nepal had only <strong>376 km of roads</strong>.</li>
                <li>As of today, Nepal's total road length stands at <strong>18,828 km</strong>, including district and urban roads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Government Initiatives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Government of Nepal (GON)</strong> has prioritized road development since the beginning of planned development in <strong>1956</strong>.</li>
                <li>In <strong>1953</strong>, the government began linking Kathmandu to the southern border with <strong>Indian assistance</strong>, opening it for traffic by <strong>1956</strong>.</li>
                <li>In <strong>1966</strong>, the <strong>Government of China</strong> constructed the Kathmandu–Kodari road, connecting Nepal to the northern border.</li>
                <li>The <strong>East-West Highway</strong> (1,028 km) was initiated during this period with support from bilateral and multilateral agencies.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Strategic Road Network (SRN)</strong> includes national highways and feeder roads, forming the backbone of Nepal's road infrastructure.</li>
                <li>The current SRN covers <strong>7,917 km</strong> with plans to extend it to <strong>9,900 km</strong> by <strong>2016</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Agencies Involved in Road Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Department of Roads (DoR)</strong>: The central agency for road construction and maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>DoLIDAR</strong>: Responsible for rural infrastructure development, especially feeder roads.</li>
                <li><strong>Municipalities</strong>: Local entities managing urban road projects and maintenance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Historical Background of Roads in Nepal</h2>
            <h3>Three Key Periods of Road Development</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Before 2007 B.S. (Rana Era):</strong> The construction of roads was limited to the Kathmandu Valley with minimal infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>2007 B.S. to 2027 B.S. (Post-Rana Era):</strong> The establishment of the <strong>Public Works Department (PWD)</strong> and the completion of significant roads like the <strong>Tribhuvan Rajpath</strong> and <strong>Kanti Rajpath</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>After 2027 B.S. (Modern Era):</strong> Road development strategy implemented with focus on <strong>National Highways</strong>, <strong>Feeder Roads</strong>, and <strong>Strategic Road Networks</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Significant Road Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tribhuvan Rajpath (2013 B.S.)</strong> - The first motorable road connecting <strong>Kathmandu to Bhainse</strong> built with Indian army engineers.</li>
                <li><strong>East-West Highway</strong> - A major national highway covering the full length of Nepal from east to west, initiated in <strong>2019 B.S.</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Hetauda-Narayangadh Road</strong> - A key all-weather, two-lane road completed in <strong>2015 B.S.</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Kodari Highway</strong> - Connecting Kathmandu to China, providing a significant trade route between Nepal and Tibet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Present Road Infrastructure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>National Road Network</strong> now comprises <strong>18,828 km</strong> of roads, including <strong>4,977 km</strong> of national highways and district roads.</li>
                <li>Out of the <strong>77 districts</strong>, <strong>76</strong> are connected to district headquarters by <strong>national road network</strong> (except <strong>Humla</strong>).</li>
                <li><strong>72 districts</strong> are now accessible by <strong>blacktopped roads</strong>.</li>
                <li>The total length of <strong>national highways</strong> is approximately <strong>14,913 km</strong>, with around <strong>7,000 km</strong> of blacktopped roads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Urban Road Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Urban roads provide access to residential, business, and industrial areas within city limits.</li>
                <li>As of <strong>2004</strong>, <strong>DOR</strong> reported a total of <strong>2,259.9 km</strong> of urban roads in Nepal.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Kathmandu Valley</strong> had just <strong>325 km of motorable roads</strong> in <strong>1992</strong>, with <strong>150 km</strong> in poor condition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The construction of the <strong>Outer Ring Road (ORR)</strong>, a proposed <strong>72 km</strong> long route around Kathmandu to handle future traffic demands.</li>
                <li>Expansion of the <strong>Inner Ring Road</strong>, supported by <strong>Chinese aid</strong> and a proposed <strong>8-lane</strong> extension.</li>
                <li>Plans to connect the remaining <strong>district headquarters</strong> by road, with <strong>Chame (Manang)</strong>, <strong>Dunai (Dolpa)</strong>, <strong>Simikot (Humla)</strong>, and <strong>Gamgadhi (Mugu)</strong> being the last few unconnected districts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Mid-Hill Highway</strong> project, aimed at improving connectivity in the mid-hills of Nepal.</li>
                <li>Widening of <strong>Koteshwor-Bhaktapur (6-lane)</strong> sector of <strong>Araniko Highway</strong> with <strong>JICA</strong> funding.</li>
                <li>Extension of <strong>North-South Corridor</strong> for improved trade routes.</li>
            </ul>
