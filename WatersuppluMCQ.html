    The primary principle behind the flocculation process in water treatment is to:
    <br>
    a) Achieve high-speed mixing for rapid particle break-up<br>
    b) Utilize slow stirring to promote collisions and floc buildup<br>
    c) Initiate rapid sedimentation of dissolved substances<br>
    d) Adjust the water pH quickly<br>
  </p>
  <div class="options">
    <button class="nav-btn">Show Answer</button>
