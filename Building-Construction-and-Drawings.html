                    <h3 >Wall and Masonry</h3>
    <h2>Stone Masonry</h2>
        <p>Stone masonry is a type of construction that uses stones bonded together with mortar. It is highly durable and commonly used for walls, foundations, and structures requiring strength and aesthetics.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Stone Masonry</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rubble Masonry:</strong> Uses irregularly shaped stones with or without mortar.</li>
            <li><strong>Ashlar Masonry:</strong> Uses precisely cut stones to create a uniform and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li><strong>Dry Stone Masonry:</strong> Constructed without mortar, relying on the weight and fit of stones.</li>
            <li><strong>Random Rubble Masonry:</strong> Uses rough and unshaped stones in an unstructured manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Coursed Rubble Masonry:</strong> Stones are placed in a leveled pattern with mortar.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Process of Stone Masonry</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Selection of Stones:</strong> Choose durable and appropriate stones for the structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Dressing of Stones:</strong> Shape the stones for proper fitting.</li>
            <li><strong>Laying the Foundation:</strong> Prepare a solid base for masonry work.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixing and Applying Mortar:</strong> Prepare the mortar mix and apply it between stones.</li>
            <li><strong>Arranging Stones:</strong> Place stones in the desired pattern, ensuring stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> Pointing and curing to ensure strength and longevity.</li>
        </ol>
 <h2>Brick Masonry</h2>
        <p>Brick masonry is a construction technique where bricks are bonded together using mortar to create walls and other structures. It is widely used due to its strength, durability, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Brick Masonry</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Burnt Clay Brick Masonry:</strong> Made from clay bricks that are fired in kilns for durability.</li>
            <li><strong>Sand Lime Brick Masonry:</strong> Composed of sand and lime, offering better strength and insulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Concrete Block Masonry:</strong> Uses concrete blocks instead of bricks for faster construction.</li>
            <li><strong>Fly Ash Brick Masonry:</strong> Made from fly ash, cement, and water, offering eco-friendly construction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Process of Brick Masonry</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preparation of Bricks:</strong> Select and soak bricks in water to remove dust and prevent moisture absorption from mortar.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixing of Mortar:</strong> Prepare the mortar mix using cement, sand, and water.</li>
            <li><strong>Laying the Foundation:</strong> Ensure a strong foundation for brickwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Laying Bricks:</strong> Place bricks in courses with proper alignment and bonding.</li>
            <li><strong>Pointing and Finishing:</strong> Fill joints with mortar and smooth the surface for durability.</li>
            <li><strong>Curing:</strong> Maintain moisture for several days to ensure strength.</li>
        </ol>
