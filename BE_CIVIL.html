<p><strong>3. Objective</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the Civil Engineering Program at Mid-West University is to prepare students with appropriate technical & 
analytical knowledge and skills to produce high quality Civil engineers and researchers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Duration of the Course</strong></p>
<p>The total duration of the course is 4 years (eight semesters). Each year consists of two semesters.</p>
<p><strong>5. Medium of Instruction and Examination</strong></p>
<p>The medium of instruction and examination of Civil Engineering Program shall be in English.
<p><strong>6. Entry Requirement for New Students</strong></p>
<p>The entry requirement for students in B.E. Civil is Intermediate in Science (I.Sc.), or Higher Secondary level (10+2) or 
Diploma in Engineering or Architecture or equivalent from a recognized institution with at least a second division marks at 
their respective Intermediate level. Besides the basic academic requirement, the candidate must have passed entrance 
examination conducted by the University.</p>
<p><strong>7. Admission Procedure</strong></p>
<p>The entrance test application form and the information brochure shall be provided on request at the Dean's Office (MU) or 
at the concerned college. The concerned college scrutinizes the applications. The eligible candidates are informed to appear 
in the entrance test. The exact date for the entrance test is communicated to the applicants by the college. The candidates 
shall be admitted on merit basis. <br>
The college may also hold interviews for the candidates before their final selection for admission. Eligible foreign national 
students may be admitted against limited seats on the basis of an interview to be conducted by the college.
The candidates, who are given provisional admission pending submission of the qualifying certificates, are required to 
submit all necessary documents within a week of the beginning of regular classes. Otherwise, the admission will be annulled.</p>
<p><strong>8. The Credit System</strong></p>
<p>Each course is assigned a certain number of credits depending generally upon its lecture, tutorial and practical work hours 
in a week. In theory subjects, one lecture hour per week is assigned one credit as a general rule.</p>
<p><strong>9. Academic Schedule</strong></p>
<p>The academic session of the University consists of two semesters per year. The Fall semester starts in November and the 
Spring Semester starts in May. For the Bachelor's program in engineering, student admission may commence either in the

<p><strong>10. Student Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The students' academic performance during a semester is evaluated using the system of continuous assessment (evaluation 
of internal assessment plus the final examination). The college and the University conduct the internal assessment and the 
final examinations, respectively. Each course shall have internal assessment marks of 50% evaluated by the assigned 
teacher. Generally, each course will have a written semester examination of 50% marks at the end of each semester.
In the Practical courses, except subject surveying and engineering geology, final examination will not be conducted and 
the internal assessment marks shall be awarded on the basis of continual assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Grading System</strong></p>
<p>The grade (marks) awarded to a student in a course is based on his/her consolidated performance in internal assessments 
and final examinations. The letter grade in any particular subject is an indication of a student’s relative performance in 
that course. The pattern of grading is as follows:</p>
 <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Letter</th>
            <th>Range</th>

<p>
Only in very rare and unusual circumstances, if a student cannot finish all the required work for the course, he/she may be 
awarded an incomplete grade "I". If all the required work is not completed within the following semester, the grade of I will 
automatically be converted to an "F". A student receiving an I grade do not need to register for that subject in the following 
semester to complete the required works.<br>
The performance of a student in a semester shall be evaluated in terms of the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) which 
is the grade point average for the semester. The cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is the grade point average for all 
completed semesters.<br>
SGPA = total honor points earned in a semester / total number of credits registered in a semester CGPA = 
total honor points earned / total number of credits completed</p>
<p><strong>11. Attendance Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The students must attend every lecture, tutorial and practical classes. However, to accommodate for sickness and other 
contingencies, the attendance requirement shall be a minimum of 80% of the classes actually held. If a student fails to attend 
80% of the classes in any particular subject, he/she shall not be allowed to take the final examination in that subject. If a 
student is continuously absent in the college for more than four weeks without notifying the Campus, his/her name will be 
removed from the college registration.</p>
<p><strong>12. Normal and Maximum Duration of Stay at the College</strong></p>
<p>The normal duration for completing the Bachelor of Civil Engineering program at the university will be four years. The 
maximum duration for the completion of the requirements shall be the normal duration plus four years.</p>
<p><strong>13. Course Registration</strong></p>
<p>The academic record of a student is maintained in terms of the courses for which he/she registers in any semester, and the 
grades he/she obtains in those courses. Registration for courses is done at the beginning of each semester. Since registration 
is a very important procedural part of the credit system, it is absolutely essential that all students present themselves at the 
campus. In case of illness or any exceptional circumstance during the registration period, he/she must inform the Campus. </p>
<p><strong>14. Repeating a Course</strong></p>
<p>A course may be taken only once for a grade, except when a student receives a D or F grade. Since passing of all core courses
individually is a degree requirement, the student must retake the failing core course when offered and must successfully 
complete the course. Retaking a course in which a student has earned a D grade is optional. However, a student cannot retake 
more than two courses in which he/she has received D grade. The grade earned on the retake will be substituted for the grade
earned first time the course was taken.</p>
<p><strong>15. Transfer of Credit Hours</strong></p>
<p>A maximum of 15 credit hours of course work completed in an equivalent program of a recognized institution may be 
transferred for credit. For transfer of credit, a student must have received a grade of B or better in the respective course. 
Courses taken earlier than five years from the time of transfer may not be accepted for transfer of credit.<br>
The concerned Subject Committee of the University will make an evaluation of the applicant for transfer of credit. The 
awarding of transferred credit will be based on the applicant's score in the college or University, which he/she attended 
previously.</p>
<p><strong>16. Course Coding for Civil Engineering</strong></p>
<p>Each course is identified by two letters followed by a three-digit number. The two letters indicate the subject area (e.g., SH 
for Science & Humanities, EL for Electrical Engineering, EX for Electronics & communication Engineering, ME for 
Mechanical Engineering, AR for Architectural Engineering, CO for Computer Engineering, CE for Civil Engineering, HE for 
Hydropower Engineering, MS for Management Science etc.). The first digit of each number indicates the 4-year bachelor 
level, second digit indicates semester (1 for first, 2 for second and so on 8 for eighth semester) and last or third digit indicates 
course sequence.
Example,
SH411 is the code for the subject Engineering Mathematics I which is offered in the Bachelor first year, where Science and 
Humanities is the subject area.</p>
<p><strong>17. Elective Courses</strong></p>
<p>The curriculum is oriented to have intensive study in the field of interest with course registration flexibility at least for three 
courses, but in future, course registration flexibility shall be increased to more number of courses.</p>
<p><strong>18. Award of Degree</strong></p>
<p>The Mid-West University awards Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree upon completion of all requirements as prescribed in 
the curriculum. MU awards grades as explained in the curriculum on the basis of individual student's relative performance. 
The minimum credit hours needed for B.E. Civil Engineering is 150 Credit hours.
Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) for the degree shall be awarded upon completion of all requirements.</p>
<p><strong>19. Scrutinizing of Final Examination Paper</strong></p>
<p>Students may apply for re-totaling or rechecking of their grades as per University rule, upon payment of prescribed fee.</p>
<p><strong>20. Final Examination</strong></p>
<p>The MU conducts final examination at the end of each semester. The procedure of final examination conduction will be as 
per the examination rules of the MU.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The provisions of this document are not to be regarded as a binding contract between the University and the 
students. The University reserves the right to change any provisions requirements contained in this document at any time, 
without pre-notification, within the students' term of residence.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only in very rare and unusual circumstances, if a student cannot finish all the required work for the course, he/she may be awarded an incomplete grade "I". If all the required work is not completed within the following semester, the grade of I will automatically be converted to an "F". A student receiving an I grade do not need to register for that subject in the following semester to complete the required works.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The performance of a student in a semester shall be evaluated in terms of the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) which is the grade point average for the semester. The cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is the grade point average for all completed semesters.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGPA = total honor points earned in a semester / total number of credits registered in a semester CGPA = total honor points earned / total number of credits completed</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>11</strong><strong>. Attendance Requirement </strong></p>
<p>The students must attend every lecture, tutorial and practical classes. However, to accommodate for sickness and other contingencies, the attendance requirement shall be a minimum of 80% of the classes actually held. If a student fails to attend 80% of the classes in any particular subject, he/she shall not be allowed to take the final examination in that subject. If a student is continuously absent in the college for more than four weeks without notifying the Campus, his/her name will be removed from the college registration.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>12</strong><strong>. Normal and Maximum Duration of Stay at the College </strong></p>
<p>The normal duration for completing the Bachelor of Civil Engineering program at the university will be four years. The maximum duration for the completion of the requirements shall be the normal duration plus four years.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>13</strong><strong>. Course Registration </strong></p>
<p>The academic record of a student is maintained in terms of the courses for which he/she registers in any semester, and the grades he/she obtains in those courses. Registration for courses is done at the beginning of each semester. Since registration is a very important procedural part of the credit system, it is absolutely essential that all students present themselves at the campus. In case of illness or any exceptional circumstance during the registration period, he/she must inform the Campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>14</strong><strong>. Repeating a Course </strong></p>
<p>A course may be taken only once for a grade, except when a student receives a D or F grade. Since passing of all core courses individually is a degree requirement, the student must retake the failing core course when offered and must successfully complete the course. Retaking a course in which a student has earned a D grade is optional. However, a student cannot retake more than two courses in which he/she has received D grade. The grade earned on the retake will be substituted for the grade earned first time the course was taken.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>15</strong> <strong>. Transfer of Credit Hours </strong></p>
<p>A maximum of 15 credit hours of course work completed in an equivalent program of a recognized institution may be transferred for credit. For transfer of credit, a student must have received a grade of B or better in the respective course. Courses taken earlier than five years from the time of transfer may not be accepted for transfer of credit.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concerned Subject Committee of the University will make an evaluation of the applicant for transfer of credit. The awarding of transferred credit will be based on the applicant's score in the college or University, which he/she attended</p>
<p>previously.</p>

<li><strong>Course Coding for Civil Engineering </strong></li>
</ol>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each course is identified by two letters followed by a three-digit number. The two letters indicate the subject area (e.g., SH for Science &amp; Humanities, EL for Electrical Engineering, EX for Electronics &amp; communication Engineering, ME for Mechanical Engineering, AR for Architectural Engineering, CO for Computer Engineering, CE for Civil Engineering, HE for Hydropower Engineering, MS for Management Science etc.). The first digit of each number indicates the 4-year bachelor level, second digit indicates semester (1 for first, 2 for second and so on 8 for eighth semester) and last or third digit indicates</p>
<p>course sequence.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Example, &nbsp;</p>
<p>SH411 is the code for the subject Engineering Mathematics I which is offered in the Bachelor first year, where Science and Humanities is the subject area.</p>

<p><strong>Course Objective: </strong>The objective of the project work is to equip the students with skills required to synthesize comprehensively the knowledge gained during the course of study for a practical application of civil engineering discipline in real life. Under the supervision and guidance of member/members of faculty each student is required to carry out an individual or group project which provides opportunities for tackling problem to civil engineering and is required to submit a project report.</p>
<p>The choice of project will depend upon the interest of student/students, faculty and the facilities available in the campus. A project may involve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preparation of a design for an expensive Civil Engineering project</li>
<li>Preparation of a Dissertation involving a literature survey, and a correlation of existing knowledge</li>
<li>An experimental investigation</li>
</ol>
<p>The project work is defined into two parts, viz. Project I and Project II. In Project I students are required to complete following works for aforementioned categories of project works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design type project</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project Description</p>
<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study Area</p>
<p>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Literature Review/Guidelines etc.</p>

<p>3.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Collection and Compilation</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the initial phase, the faculty may conduct a number of lectures and discussions as to the approach of the project. In the later phase, the student will be left on his/their won to pursue his/their work and to consult the faculty whenever any problem crops up. The student/s should then submit a draft report, prior to the final report, so that the supervisor can review the work, and correct the mistakes, if necessary. The final draft of the report of the report shall be submitted to the Head of Department in duplicate.</p>
