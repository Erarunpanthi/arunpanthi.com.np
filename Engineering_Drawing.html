        <h2>What is Engineering Drawing?</h2>
        <p>Engineering drawing is a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional objects. It provides essential information about the shape, size, surface quality, material, and manufacturing process of an object. It serves as a universal graphic language that allows trained professionals to visualize and understand objects.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Drawing Instruments and Aids</h2>
        <p>To create accurate engineering drawings, the following instruments and aids are used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drawing Board:</strong> A flat surface used for drafting, traditionally made of softwood.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Squares:</strong> Used for drawing angles and straight lines.</li>
            <li><strong>French Curves:</strong> Used for drawing smooth curves.</li>
            <li><strong>Templates:</strong> Pre-designed shapes for drawing common features like circles, ellipses, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Mini Drafter:</strong> A versatile tool that combines the functions of a T-square, set squares, scales, and protractor.</li>
            <li><strong>Instrument Box:</strong> Contains compasses, dividers, and inking pens.</li>
            <li><strong>Protractor:</strong> Used for measuring and drawing angles.</li>
            <li><strong>Set of Scales:</strong> Used for measuring and scaling drawings.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawing Sheets:</strong> Standardized paper used for drafting.</li>
            <li><strong>Pencils:</strong> Different grades of pencils are used for various types of lines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Drawing Board</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, drawing boards were made of well-seasoned softwood, about 25 mm thick, with a working edge for T-squares. Modern drafting often uses mini-drafters, which can be fixed on any board. The size of the drawing board depends on the size of the drawing sheet required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Mini-Drafter</h2>
        <p>A mini-drafter consists of two arms with scales, rigidly hinged to form an angle. It combines the functions of a T-square, set squares, scales, and protractor. It is used for drawing horizontal, vertical, and inclined lines, as well as parallel and perpendicular lines. It also helps in measuring lines and angles accurately.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Instrument Box</h2>
        <p>The instrument box contains essential tools for drafting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compasses:</strong> Used for drawing circles and arcs.</li>
            <li><strong>Dividers:</strong> Used for measuring and transferring distances.</li>
            <li><strong>Inking Pens:</strong> Used for inking drawings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The pencil lead in the compass should be at least 1 mm above the tip to ensure proper grip on the drawing board.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Pencils for Drafting</h2>
        <p>Pencils with different grades of hardness are used for various purposes in engineering drawing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HB:</strong> Soft grade for border lines, lettering, and free sketching.</li>
            <li><strong>H:</strong> Medium grade for visible outlines, edges, and boundary lines.</li>
            <li><strong>2H:</strong> Hard grade for construction lines, dimension lines, leader lines, extension lines, center lines, hatching lines, and hidden lines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The hardness of the pencil lead increases with the numeral before "H" (e.g., 3H is harder than 2H). Conversely, the lead becomes softer as the numeral before "B" increases (e.g., 3B is softer than 2B).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Drawing Sheet Sizes</h2>
        <p>Standard drawing sheet sizes are based on the principle of x:y = 1:√2, where x and y are the sides of the sheet. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A0:</strong> 841 mm x 1189 mm (1 square meter area).</li>
            <li>Successive sizes (A1, A2, A3, etc.) are obtained by halving the length or doubling the width, maintaining an area ratio of 1:2.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Title Block</h2>
        <p>The title block is located at the bottom right corner of the drawing sheet and includes the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title of the drawing</li>
            <li>Drawing number</li>
            <li>Scale</li>
            <li>Symbol denoting the method of projection</li>
            <li>Name of the firm</li>
            <li>Initials of the staff involved (designer, checker, and approver)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Lines in Engineering Drawing</h2>
        <p>Different types of lines are used to convey specific meanings in engineering drawings:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Line Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Visible Outlines/Edges</td>
                <td>Continuous wide lines representing visible edges of objects.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dimension Lines</td>
                <td>Continuous narrow lines used to mark dimensions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Extension Lines</td>
                <td>Continuous narrow lines extended slightly beyond dimension lines.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Construction Lines</td>
                <td>Continuous narrow lines used for constructing drawings (not erased after completion).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hatching/Section Lines</td>
                <td>Continuous narrow lines drawn at 45° for sectioned portions of an object.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
