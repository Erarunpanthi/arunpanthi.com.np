<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance Of Water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water is one of the five most crucial elements for human existence, alongside air, food, heat, and light. Next to air, water is the most essential for human life. An adequate supply of water, both in quantity and quality, is vital for human survival.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrient Importance:</strong> Water is perhaps the most important nutrient in our diets. An adult needs to drink about 2 liters (8 glasses) of water daily to replenish the water lost through the skin, respiratory tract, and urine.</p>
<p><strong>Usable Water:</strong> Only 0.3% of the Earth&rsquo;s water is usable by humans. The rest is saltwater, ice, or water vapor.</p>
<p><strong>Freshwater Sources:</strong> Freshwater is found in rivers, lakes, and underground sources. However, not all freshwater is suitable for drinking.</p>
<p><strong>Health Impact:</strong> Contaminated water can cause serious diseases like cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis. Industrial waste and agricultural chemicals can also make water toxic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Types of Water</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pure Water:</strong> Contains only hydrogen and oxygen (H₂O). It is colorless, tasteless, and odorless. Pure water is not found in nature as it dissolves gases and minerals from the atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Impure Water:</strong> Contains minerals and other substances. It is used for drinking but must be within acceptable limits.</li>
<li><strong>Potable Water:</strong> Safe for drinking, with a pleasant taste and suitable for domestic use.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesome Water: </strong>Contains beneficial minerals and is free from harmful impurities.</li>
</ol>
<p>☺<strong>Requirements of Wholesome Water:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free from microorganisms, radioactive substances, dissolved gases, salts, and heavy metals.</li>
<li>Colorless and sparkling.</li>
<li>Tasty, odor-free, and cool.</li>
<li>Free from objectionable matter.</li>
<li>Non-corrosive to pipes.</li>
<li>Contains dissolved oxygen and is free from carbonic acid.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Polluted Water:</strong> Contains excess impurities like minerals, salts, gases, and microorganisms. Not fit for drinking.</li>
<li><strong>Contaminated Water:</strong> Contains harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals that cause diseases.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Development Of Water Supply System</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Early Settlements:</strong> Developed near rivers for easy access to water. As populations grew, the demand for water increased, leading to pollution and depletion of water sources.</p>
<p><strong>Water Supply Systems:</strong> Developed to provide clean, accessible water. In Nepal, traditional sources included hiti, kuwa, dhunge dhara, and wells.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Systems:</strong> The first piped water supply in Nepal was the Bir Dhara system in 1895. The Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) was established in 1972 to provide nationwide service.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectives of Water Supply System</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary objective of a water supply system is to provide water from the best available source, ensuring it is of good physical quality, free from unpleasant taste or odor, and safe for health.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Provide safe, wholesome water to consumers in adequate quantity efficiently and at low cost.</li>
<li>2 Make water easily accessible to the public.</li>
<li>3 Ensure adequate provisions for emergencies like firefighting, festivals, and meetings.</li>
<li>4 Save time in fetching water.</li>
<li>5 Supply water reliably, with high quality and quantity, effectively and efficiently.</li>

<li><strong>SOURCES OF WATER</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classification of Sources of Water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water obtained through precipitation is retained in surface depressions, carried away as surface runoff in natural streams or rivers, and percolates into the ground to join the groundwater. This portion of precipitation, which may be utilized for water supply, is available partly at the ground surface and partly below the ground surface. Various sources of water available for water supply can be broadly classified into the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Sources of Water</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Surface Sources: </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1 Rivers</li>
<li>2 Streams</li>
<li>3 Lakes</li>
<li>4 Ponds</li>
<li>5 Impounding Reservoirs</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Ground Sources</strong></li>
<li><strong>Springs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gravity Springs:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1 Depression Springs</li>
<li>2 Surface/Contact Springs</li>
<li>3 Artesian Springs</li>
<li>4 Non-Gravity Springs</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wells:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Open Wells</li>
<li>Tube Wells</li>
<li>Artesian Wells</li>
<li>Infiltration Galleries</li>
<li>Infiltration Wells</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from ground and surface sources, rainwater harvesting is also practiced nowadays. It requires large storage but saves treatment costs. Wastewater reclamation is practiced in developed countries, which requires significant installation and maintenance costs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface Sources Of Water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water available at the ground/earth surface is termed as a surface source. The quality and quantity of surface water depend on rainfall patterns, climatic, and geological factors. The quality of water varies from its origin until it reaches the oceans. During storms, surface water carries numerous impurities such as organic and suspended matter. Various forms of surface sources of water include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ponds:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ponds are natural or artificial depressions filled with water, primarily from rainfall. They contain many impurities and are not suitable for water supply purposes. The quantity of water in ponds is usually low and is used for washing, animal bathing, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Lakes:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Lakes are large natural depressions or hollows formed in the earth&rsquo;s surface, filled with water. They are mostly found in mountainous regions. The quantity of water in lakes is generally large, depending on their size, catchment area, annual rainfall, ground porosity, and geological formation. The quality of lake water depends on the characteristics of the catchment area. Lakes in uninhabited upland hilly areas have relatively good quality water, though small lakes with still water may require high degrees of treatment due to algae, weeds, and other vegetation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Streams:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Streams are natural channels that carry surface runoff from small catchments. They may be perennial or non-perennial. The quality of water in streams is generally good in high altitudes, except during the first runoff. Streams may contain impurities and require some treatment.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Rivers:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Rivers are natural channels that carry surface runoff from their catchment or drainage area. They can be perennial (water available throughout the year) or non-perennial (water not available throughout the year). Perennial rivers are fed by rains and melting snow. River water quality is good near the point of origin in the mountains but deteriorates as the river approaches plains, picking up suspended matter, clay, and silt, making the water muddy and requiring treatment.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Storage/Impounding Reservoirs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Storage or impounding reservoirs are artificial lakes created by constructing a dam or barrier across a river. They store excess water during high flow periods for use during low flow periods. The quality of water in storage reservoirs depends on the quality of the river water and needs proper analysis and treatment before supply. Construction of impounding reservoirs is not feasible when the average annual flow is lower than the average demand or when the river&rsquo;s flow rate in the dry season exceeds the demand.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ground/Sub-Surface Sources of Water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water existing below the ground surface is termed as a ground source. Groundwater acquires its chemical characteristics from surface water that percolates into the ground. The quality of groundwater is generally good due to natural filtration as it percolates and infiltrates deeper strata. Groundwater is not exposed to the atmosphere, making it free from direct contamination and pollution from runoff. Various forms of ground sources of water include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Springs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Springs occur when an aquifer or underground channel reaches the ground surface, causing water to flow naturally. They are classified into:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gravity Springs: </strong>Water flows naturally due to gravity.</li>
<li><strong>Depression Spring:</strong> Formed by the overflowing of the water table where the ground surface intersects it. Flow varies with the water table&rsquo;s rise and fall.</li>
<li><strong>Contact/Surface Spring:</strong> Created by a permeable water-bearing formation overlying a less permeable formation that intersects the ground surface.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Gravity Springs:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Volcanic Springs:</strong> Associated with volcanic rocks, often thermal and mineralized.</p>
<p><strong>Fissure Springs:</strong> Result from fractures extending deep into the earth&rsquo;s crust, often thermal and mineralized.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Artesian Spring: </strong>Release of groundwater under pressure from a confined aquifer through an opening in the confining bed.</li>
<li>Non-Gravity Springs: Water does not flow naturally and may require pumping.</li>
<li><strong>Infiltration Galleries</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Infiltration galleries are horizontal tunnels or pipes laid below the water table to collect groundwater.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Infiltration Wells</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Infiltration wells are vertical wells that collect groundwater through infiltration.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Wells and Tube Wells</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A tube well is a long pipe sunk into the ground to access water-bearing strata. They have smaller diameters compared to open wells and can be classified into:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open/Dug/Draw Wells:</strong> Shallow and deep wells that collect groundwater. Large diameters, low yields, shallow depths (1-10 m diameter, 2-20 m depth). Construction: Built with brick, stone masonry, or precast rings.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Types:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shallow Open Wells:</strong> Rest in the top water-bearing strata, drawing water from the surroundings. Risk of contamination is high.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Open Wells:</strong> Penetrate deeper into the ground, accessing water from deeper strata.</li>
<li><strong>Tube Wells:</strong> A tube well is a long pipe sunk into the ground to access water-bearing strata. They have smaller diameters compared to open wells and can be classified into:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Type:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strainer Type Tube Well:</strong></li>
<li>Most common type.</li>
<li>Uses a combination of strainer and blind pipes.</li>
<li>Strainer pipes rest against water-bearing strata, while blind pipes rest against impervious strata.</li>
<li><strong>Cavity Type Tube Well:</strong></li>
<li>Pipe rests on a strong stratum.</li>
<li>Initially pumps sandy water, forming a cavity at the bottom.</li>
<li>Over time, clear water is obtained.</li>
<li><strong>Slotted Type Tube Well:</strong></li>
<li>Pipe is slotted at one end and plain at the other.</li>
<li>Surrounded by a mixture of gravel and coarse sand to prevent fine sand from entering.</li>
<li><strong>Perforated Type Tube Well:</strong></li>
<li>Shallow depth, used for short durations.</li>
<li>Pipes covered with jute ropes act as strainers.</li>
<li><strong>Artesian Wells</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>An artesian well is a pump-less water source where groundwater flows automatically under pressure from a confined aquifer. They are typically found in valleys where aquifers are inclined towards the valley, causing water to flow under pressure.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Types of Aquifers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>An aquifer is a geological formation that contains sufficient permeable material to store and transmit water. Common terms include groundwater reservoir and water-bearing formation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Confined Aquifer: </strong>Groundwater is confined under pressure greater than atmospheric pressure by overlying impermeable strata, also known as artesian or pressure aquifer.</li>
<li><strong>Unconfined Aquifer: </strong>The water table forms the upper surface of the zone of saturation.</li>
<li><strong>Aquiclude and Aquifuge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Aquiclude:</strong> An impermeable body of rock or sediment that acts as a barrier to water flow (e.g., clay layer).</li>
<li><strong>Aquifuge:</strong> An impermeable body of rock with no interconnected openings, neither absorbing nor transmitting water (e.g., granite bed).</li>

<li><strong>Selection of Water Source</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting a water source for a town or city, several factors must be considered to ensure reliability, sustainability, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Here are the key factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quality of Water: </strong>The source should provide safe, wholesome water free from pollution and undesirable impurities. The fewer impurities, the easier and cheaper it is to treat the water.</li>
<li><strong>Quantity of Water:</strong> The source must supply enough water to meet the city&rsquo;s demands throughout the design period, even during dry seasons. The safe yield should be adequate to meet the desired demand year-round.</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Ideally, the water source should be close to the community and situated in an elevated area to reduce the length of pipes and allow gravity flow, minimizing pumping costs. Surface sources are often preferred over groundwater to avoid environmental impacts like lowering the water table.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Water Supply Project: </strong>The overall cost should be minimized to provide affordable water to consumers. Costs depend on the source&rsquo;s location, elevation, water quality, topography, and distance from the community.</li>
<li><strong>QUANTITY OF WATER</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Designing a water supply project involves determining the daily water demand, which depends on the population and per capita demand. The design period should be realistic, balancing financial and practical considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Per Capita Demand</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Per capita demand is the average daily water consumption per person, including all uses. It is calculated using the formula:</p>
<p>where ( Q ) is the total annual water requirement in liters, and ( P ) is the population.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design and Base Periods</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The design period is the number of years a water supply project is planned to serve, considering future demand. It should be neither too long (financially burdensome) nor too short (uneconomical).</p>
<p><strong>Factors influencing the design period include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Availability of Funds:</strong> Limited funds may necessitate a shorter design period.</li>
<li><strong>Availability of Water:</strong> The source must provide sufficient water for the design period.</li>
<li><strong>Population Growth Rate:</strong> Higher growth rates may require shorter design periods.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Development:</strong> Rapid development may shorten the design period.</li>
<li><strong>Life of Pipes and Materials:</strong> The design period should not exceed the useful life of components.</li>
<li><strong>Rate of Interest on Loans:</strong> Higher interest rates may shorten the design period.</li>

<li><strong>QUALITY OF WATER</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Pure water is rarely found in nature. Even rainwater, which is initially pure, picks up gases, dust, and other substances as it passes through the atmosphere. As it reaches the earth&rsquo;s surface, it collects organic and suspended matter. Groundwater, which percolates through the soil, dissolves various salts, minerals, and organic and inorganic matter. Thus, water from both surface and ground sources contains impurities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impurities in Water, Their Classification, and Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Impurities in water can be classified in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Based on Properties or Characteristics:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Impurities:</strong> Affect color, odor, taste, and turbidity. Examples include organic matter, minerals, and microorganisms.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Impurities:</strong> Affect pH, solids, salts, hardness, alkalinity, chloride, and nitrogen. These can cause various diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Bacteriological Impurities:</strong> Include pathogenic (e.g., Salmonella) and non-pathogenic (e.g., E. coli) microorganisms, which can cause diseases.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Based on State of Presence/Occurrences:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspended Impurities:</strong> Solid particles causing turbidity, such as silt, clay, algae, fungi, and organic and inorganic matter. These can be removed by settling or filtration.</li>
<li><strong>Dissolved Impurities:</strong> Organic compounds, inorganic salts, and gases dissolved in water. Examples include salts of calcium and magnesium, iron oxide, and gases like O₂ and CO₂. These can be removed by precipitation, adsorption, or distillation.</li>
<li><strong>Colloidal Impurities:</strong> Very small particles that cannot be removed by ordinary filters. They remain in continuous motion due to their electrical charge and are often associated with bacteria. These can be removed by coagulation and sedimentation followed by filtration.</li>

<li><strong>Hardness and Alkalinity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Hardness is a characteristic of water that prevents the formation of sufficient lather or foam with soap. It is caused by the presence of bicarbonates, sulphates, chlorides, and nitrates of calcium and magnesium. Excessive hardness can interfere with soap usage, boiler operations, dyeing processes, and can cause corrosion in pipes and affect the taste of food.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Hardness</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Temporary or Carbonate Hardness (CH): </strong>Caused by bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium. Also known as temporary hardness. Can be removed by boiling the water or adding lime.</li>
<li><strong>Permanent or Non-carbonate Hardness (NCH): </strong>Caused by sulphates, chlorides, and nitrates of calcium and magnesium. Also known as permanent hardness. Cannot be removed by simple boiling.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hardness is expressed in terms of equivalent amount of CaCO₃.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Alkalinity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Alkalinity is caused by hydroxides, carbonates, and bicarbonates, with most natural alkalinity due to bicarbonates. It can be classified as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hydroxide Alkalinity (Caustic Alkalinity):</strong> Caused by hydroxides.</li>
<li><strong>Carbonate Alkalinity:</strong> Caused by carbonates.</li>
<li><strong>Bicarbonate Alkalinity: </strong>Caused by bicarbonates.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>☺</strong><strong>Total alkalinity (TA) is the sum of carbonate alkalinity (CA) and bicarbonate alkalinity (BCA).</strong></p>

</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water-Related Diseases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Safe water is essential to control many diseases. Water-related diseases are classified into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>41 </strong><strong>Water-Borne Diseases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms transmitted through contaminated water. Infection can occur during bathing, washing, drinking, food preparation, or consumption of contaminated food. Common water-borne diseases include:</p>
<p><strong>Cholera:</strong> Caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, leading to severe vomiting and watery stools.</p>
<p><strong>Typhoid Fever:</strong> Caused by Salmonella bacteria, characterized by fever, headache, slow heartbeat, and malaise.</p>
<p><strong>Diarrhea:</strong> An intestinal disorder caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites, leading to frequent and fluid fecal evacuations.</p>
<p><strong>Dysentery:</strong> An infectious disease causing inflammation and ulceration of the bowels, resulting in mucous and hemorrhagic diarrhea.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>42 </strong><strong>Water-Washed Diseases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These diseases are transmitted due to lack of cleanliness, poor sanitation, and inadequate water usage. They depend on the quantity of water used rather than its quality. Common water-washed diseases include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scabies:</strong> A contagious skin disease caused by the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei.</p>
<p><strong>Trachoma:</strong> A chronic eye disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, leading to inflammation and potential blindness.</p>
<p><strong>Bacillary Dysentery (Shigellosis):</strong> An acute intestinal infection caused by Shigella bacteria, common among children.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>43 </strong><strong>Water-Based Diseases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These diseases involve pathogens that spend part of their life cycle in water or aquatic animals. They are also known as water contact diseases. Examples include:</p>
<p><strong>Schistosomiasis:</strong> Caused by parasitic flukes of the genus Schistosoma, transmitted through feces-contaminated water or snails.</p>
<p><strong>Guinea Worm Disease:</strong> Caused by the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis, transmitted through contaminated water.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>44 </strong><strong>Water Vector Diseases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These diseases are spread by insects that breed in or near water. The transmission involves a host, a parasite, and a vector (insect, fly, or mosquito). Examples include:</p>
<p><strong>Malaria:</strong> Caused by Plasmodium protozoa, transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito.</p>
<p><strong>Onchocerciasis (River Blindness):</strong> Caused by filarial worms of the genus Onchocerca, transmitted by black flies.</p>
<p><strong>Dengue: </strong>An eruptive fever caused by a virus, transmitted by mosquito bites.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>45 </strong><strong>Transmission Routes and Preventive Measures</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water-related diseases are often spread due to inadequate water supply and sanitation (WATSAN). Pathogens present in human excreta can contaminate water and food, leading to infection. Common transmission routes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Dirty hands, clothes, cooking vessels, and mugs.</li>
<li>2 Uncovered food and drinking water.</li>
<li>3 Contaminated water.</li>
<li>4 Open defecation.</li>
<li>5</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To effectively prevent water-related diseases, it&rsquo;s crucial to identify the transmission mechanisms and employ barriers or interventions to interrupt the transmission routes. Here are some key preventive measures:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Improve Water Quality at the Source:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1 Disinfect water before use, especially in areas with questionable water quality.</li>
<li>2 Common household disinfection methods include:</li>
<li>3 Boiling water vigorously for one minute to kill most microorganisms.</li>
<li>4 Using chlorine bleach, tincture of iodine, or iodine tablets.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Interrupt Transmission Routes:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1 Protect food from flies.</li>
<li>2 Chlorinate water.</li>
<li>3 Maintain proper sanitation.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Ensure Proper Hygiene:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1 Drink only filtered water.</li>
<li>2 Wash hands properly before eating.</li>
<li>3 Eat cooked, warm foods.</li>
<li>4 Keep fingernails short and clean.</li>
<li>5 Use proper toilets for defecation.</li>
<li>6 Wash food before cooking and cook at high temperatures to kill harmful bacteria.</li>
<li>7 Dispose of animal and organic wastes properly to avoid flies.</li>
<li>8 Dispose of infant and toddler feces properly.</li>
<li>9 Avoid consuming foods, fruit juices, and milkshakes from roadside vendors.</li>
<li>10 Keep foods and beverages covered.</li>
<li>11 Avoid drinking water at parks and recreational places; carry bottled water or your own water.</li>
<li>12 Wash hands frequently, especially before preparing food, before eating, after using the toilet, changing diapers, using a handkerchief, changing soiled clothes or beddings, caring for people with water-borne illnesses, and after playing with pets and animals.</li>
<li><strong>Examination of Water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water examination, or water analysis, is conducted to identify water quality and the presence of impurities. The purposes of water analysis include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ascertaining the quality of water and the quantity of various impurities.</li>
<li>Verifying if treated water meets standards.</li>
<li>Identifying the dose of chlorine, coagulant, etc., in treatment plants.</li>
<li>Prescribing the degree of treatment required for the desired water quality.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sampling Techniques</strong></li>
<li>Use fully cleaned bottles, buckets, or jerricans for physical tests; containers should be greater than 2 liters for biological and chemical tests.</li>
<li>Rinse containers before sampling.</li>
<li>Shake the sample well before testing to ensure air remains in the container.</li>
<li>Let the tap run for 2-3 minutes to avoid stagnant water during sample collection from distribution lines.</li>
<li>When sampling from a well with a hand pump, pump water for about 5 minutes before collecting it in a clean, sterilized container. If there is no hand pump, take the water directly from the well.</li>
<li>For river, reservoir, or lake samples, take water from 40-50 cm below the surface, not too far or near the draw-off site.</li>
<li>Test samples within 1 hour of collection for microbiological tests; if not possible, keep the sample in an ice chest or cooler for up to 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Examination of Water</strong></li>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Measured by ordinary thermometers. Ideal for public water supply is between 10&deg;C to 15.6&deg;C. Temperatures above 25&deg;C are undesirable, and above 35&deg;C are unfit for public supply.</li>
<li><strong>Colour:</strong> Pure water is colorless. Colour in water is measured by its ability to absorb light, using a tintometer. Drinking water should not have a colour greater than 5 ppm on the platinum-cobalt scale.</li>
<li><strong>Turbidity:</strong> Measured by the extent to which light is absorbed or scattered by suspended material in water. Turbidity is measured photometrically. Acceptable turbidity is 5 ppm, and it is rejected if greater than 10 NTU.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Examination of Water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The chemical examination of water involves tests to determine the chemical impurities and characteristics of water.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Solids: </strong>Total solids in water include both dissolved and suspended solids, expressed in ppm or mg/liter.
<ol>
<li><strong>Filterable Solids:</strong> Pass through filter paper.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Dissolved Solids</li>
<li>Colloidal Solids
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Non-Filterable Solids:</strong> Retained on filter paper.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Suspended Solids</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Settlable Solids</li>
<li>Non-Settlable Solids</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fixed Solids:</strong> Inorganic solids (e.g., sand, gravel).</li>
<li><strong>Volatile Solids:</strong> Organic solids.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Nitrogenous: Urea, proteins, amines, amino acids.</li>
<li>Non-Nitrogenous: Carbohydrates, soaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>To measure total solids, a water sample is evaporated at 103&deg;C to 105&deg;C for 24 hours. The residue is total solids. If ignited in a muffle furnace at 600&deg;C for 15-20 minutes, volatile solids escape, leaving fixed or inorganic solids.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pH</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of water on a scale of 0 to 14. It is determined by electrometric and colorimetric methods. The pH value for drinking water, as per Nepal&rsquo;s National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS), is 6.5 to 8.5.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological Examination of Water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Pathogenic bacteria are difficult to detect in water due to their small numbers and irregular presence. Instead, indicator organisms like E. coli are used to infer contamination.</p>
<p><strong>Methods for Detecting Coliform Bacteria</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Total Count or Agar Plate Count Test:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Dilute 1 ml of water sample in 99 ml of sterilized/distilled water.</li>
<li>Mix 1 ml of diluted water with 10 ml of agar gelatin.</li>
<li>Incubate at 37&deg;C for 24-48 hours.</li>
<li>Count bacterial colonies and compute results per 100 ml. For drinking water, the total count should not exceed 1 per 100 ml.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Multiple Tube Fermentation Technique/E. coli Test:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Presumptive Test:</strong> Detects gas production from lactose fermentation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Incubate water samples in lactose broth at 37&deg;C for 48 hours.</li>
<li>Presence of gas indicates E. coli.
<ol>
<li><strong>Confirmed Test:</strong> Uses brilliant green lactose bile to suppress non-coliform bacteria.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Incubate at 37&deg;C for 48 hours.</li>
<li>Gas production confirms coliform presence.
<ol>
<li><strong>Completed Test:</strong> Further confirms coliform presence by re-incubating in lactose broth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Incubate at 37&deg;C for 24-48 hours.</li>
<li>Gas production indicates E. coli.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Membrane Filter Technique:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Retain bacteria on a membrane with microscopic pores.</li>
<li>Place membrane in contact with M-Endo&rsquo;s medium.</li>
<li>Incubate at 37&deg;C for 20 hours.</li>
<li>Count visible coliform colonies under a microscope.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Most Probable Number (MPN) Index</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>MPN is a statistical method to estimate bacterial density in water.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Number of positive portions: 1</p>
<p>Total volume in all tubes: 50 ml</p>
<p>Total volume in negative portions: 40 ml</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water Quality Standards for Drinking Purposes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water from natural sources often contains various impurities at different concentrations. While some minerals in water can be beneficial, higher concentrations of certain impurities can cause diseases. The maximum concentration limit of impurities in water, beyond which it becomes harmful to human health, is termed as water quality standards. These standards describe the quality parameters set for drinking water.</p>

<li><strong>INTAKES</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>An intake is a device or structure installed in a water source to withdraw water and discharge it into an intake conduit, then to the treatment plant. It consists of openings, gratings or strainers, valves, operating devices, pumps, and a structure or housing to support the intake conduit.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site Selection of an Intake</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Key considerations for selecting an intake site include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proximity to the treatment plant to reduce conveyance costs.</li>
<li>High water quality to reduce treatment costs.</li>
<li>Avoiding locations near wastewater disposal points.</li>
<li>Ensuring supply during worst conditions by fetching water from deeper portions of the river.</li>
<li>Allowing for future extensions and additions.</li>
<li>Accessibility during floods.</li>
<li>Avoiding meandering sections of rivers; prefer concave or outer banks.</li>
<li>Geologically stable locations free from erosion, silting, scouring, and heavy currents.</li>
<li>Good road connectivity.</li>
<li>Considering natural factors like seasonal variations, winds, currents, and climate.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classification of Intakes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Intakes can be classified based on various criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intake Top:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Submerged</p>
<p>Exposed</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water Retained Inside Housing:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dry Intake</p>
<p>Wet Intake</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of Water:</strong>
<ol>
<li>River Intake</li>
<li>Reservoir Intake</li>
<li>Spring Intake</li>
<li>Lake Intake</li>
<li>Canal Intake</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Types of Intakes</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>River Intakes: </strong>Constructed at the river bank to acquire water. Consists of an intake tower with multiple inlets (penstocks) at different levels. Can be wet or dry intakes.</li>
<li><strong>Reservoir Intakes: </strong>Used when a dam or weir is constructed across a river to meet dry season demand. <strong><em>Types include earthen and gravity dams. </em></strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Earthen dams have intake towers with penstocks at different levels.</li>
<li>Gravity dams can have single or multiple ports for water entry.
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Spring Intakes: </strong>A spring is a natural point where groundwater emerges on the earth&rsquo;s surface. An intake constructed at the spring source to draw off water is called a spring intake. Springs are generally found on hill slopes due to geological formations where impervious layers outcrop. Typically, spring water does not contain suspended impurities or harmful bacteria, making it suitable for small rural water supply schemes in Nepal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Contamination Prevention</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Springs are susceptible to contamination by surface water, especially during rainstorms. To prevent this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Construct a U-shaped surface drainage diversion ditch or an earth berm at least 15 meters uphill from the spring to divert surface runoff.</li>
<li>Fence an area at least 30 meters in all directions around the spring box to prevent contamination by livestock and unaware people.</li>
<li>Plant vegetation around the spring source to maintain discharge.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Requirements for Spring Intake Location</strong></li>
<li><strong>Proximity to Source:</strong> Should be as close to the source as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Elevation:</strong> Should be above populated or farming areas.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility: </strong>Should be above footpaths, cattle watering, and washing places.</li>
<li><strong>Drainage: </strong>Should allow easy drainage of surface runoff during rain.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility: </strong>Should not be easily accessible to people and livestock.</li>
<li><strong>Water Logging:</strong> Should not allow water logging near the intake.</li>
<li><strong>Construction Considerations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Backup Pressure Prevention: </strong>Construct the collection chamber away from the source with a head of about 4 to 5 meters to allow free flow.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Stone Soiling: </strong>Prevent leakage by avoiding stone soiling below the floor.</li>
<li><strong>Light Structure: </strong>Avoid heavy intake structures to prevent settlement.</li>
<li><strong>Valve Box Space:</strong> Provide adequate space in the valve box for easy repair and maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Union Provision:</strong> Include unions to avoid complex problems during gate valve replacement.</li>
<li><strong>Careful Excavation: </strong>Avoid over-excavation of the impervious layer at the base of the spring outlet to prevent loss of flow.</li>
<li><strong>Inlet Pipe Protection:</strong> Cover the inlet pipe with stone soiling and impervious material upstream to prevent entry of suspended particles.</li>
<li><strong>Animal Access Restriction:</strong> Restrict animal access within at least 30 meters of the intake to avoid contamination.</li>
<li><strong>Surface Runoff Drainage:</strong> Ensure easy drainage of surface runoff by providing drains around the intake area.</li>
<li><strong>Yield Consideration:</strong> Springs with a yield of less than 0.05 liters per second should not be tapped for gravity flow schemes.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>TREATMENT OF WATER</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Water treatment involves processes to make water suitable for its intended purpose by removing or reducing impurities. The goal is to produce water that is hygienically safe, aesthetically attractive, and palatable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectives of Water Treatment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Meet Standards:</strong> Ensure water meets requisite standards.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Impurities:</strong> Lower impurities to acceptable levels.</li>
<li><strong>Potability: </strong>Make water safe for drinking.</li>
<li><strong>Disinfection:</strong> Kill disease-causing organisms.</li>
<li><strong>Corrosion Minimization: </strong>Reduce water&rsquo;s corrosive nature to protect pipes.</li>
<li><strong>Water Treatment Processes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The choice and arrangement of processes depend on factors like raw water quality, desired standards, source type, impurity types, available funds, and supply purpose. Common processes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screening: </strong>Removes large suspended and floating matters.</li>
<li><strong>Plain Sedimentation: </strong>Separates coarse or heavier suspended particles.</li>
<li><strong>Sedimentation with Coagulation:</strong> Removes electrically charged finer particles, especially colloidal.</li>
<li><strong>Filtration:</strong> Removes bacteria, finer particles, and colloidal matter.</li>
<li><strong>Disinfection: </strong>Kills pathogenic microorganisms, commonly using chlorination.</li>
<li><strong>Aeration:</strong> Removes color, odor, taste, and dissolved gases.</li>
<li><strong>Softening:</strong> Removes hardness from water.</li>
<li><strong>De-chlorination: </strong>Removes excess chlorine.</li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous Treatments:</strong> Removes iron, manganese, and other harmful substances.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Screening</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Screening is the process of passing water through screens to remove large suspended matters like sticks, branches, leaves, dead animals, and debris. Screens have uniform-sized openings and can be circular or rectangular. The screening element can be made of parallel bars, rods, wires, grating, wire mesh, or perforated plates.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Screens</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bar Rack or Coarse Screen:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Used at the beginning of water purification to trap large floating matters.</li>
<li>Typically has clear openings of 50 mm or more (generally 75-150 mm).</li>
<li>Made of circular or rectangular bars with horizontal spacing of 75 to 150 mm.</li>
<li>Placed vertically or inclined at 30&deg; to 80&deg; with the vertical.</li>
<li>Trapped matters are removed manually or mechanically.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Medium Screen:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Has clear openings of about 20 to 50 mm.</li>
<li>Used to trap medium-sized screenings, often placed at the inlet of pumps.</li>
<li>Maximum allowable head loss to a clogged rack or screen is 0.8 m.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Perforated or Fine Screen:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Used to remove small suspended matters.</li>
<li>Generally not used because it clogs quickly and needs frequent cleaning.</li>
<li>Made of perforated plates with 0.6 cm diameter perforations.</li>
<li>May have a mechanical cleaning device, such as a rotating disc cleaned by a cone brush.</li>
<li>Used at surface water intakes, sometimes alone or following a bar rack.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sedimentation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sedimentation is the process of separating solid matter from water by gravity. It is commonly used in water treatment to remove suspended particles, including bacteria.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose of Settling</strong>
<ol>
<li>Remove coarse dispersed phase.</li>
<li>Remove coagulated and flocculated impurities.</li>
<li>Remove precipitated impurities after chemical treatment.</li>
<li>Reduce the burden on subsequent processes.</li>
<li>Reduce the dose of chemicals in subsequent processes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Settling Velocity of Discrete Particles</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a discrete particle is placed in a quiescent fluid, it accelerates until the frictional resistance (drag force) equals the impelling force (driving force). At this stage, the particle attains a uniform or terminal velocity, known as settling velocity.</p>
<p>Impelling/Driving Force:</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&nbsp;= Unit weight of the particle</p>
<p>&nbsp;= Unit weight of the fluid</p>
<p>&nbsp;= Mass density of the particle</p>
<p>= Mass density of the fluid</p>
<p>(g) = Acceleration due to gravity</p>
<p>(V) = Volume of the particle</p>
<p>Drag Force:</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&nbsp;= Drag coefficient</p>
<p>(A) = Projected area of the particle</p>
<p>&nbsp;= Settling velocity</p>
<p>Equating Forces:</p>
<p>Settling Velocity:</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>(d) = Diameter of the particle</p>
<p>(S) = Specific gravity of the particle</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideal Sedimentation Tank</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An ideal sedimentation tank ensures that the time taken by water particles to move from the inlet to the outlet is equal to the time taken by suspended particles to settle. It is divided into four zones:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inlet Zone:</strong> Dissipates momentum and establishes uniform flow.</li>
<li><strong>Settling Zone:</strong> Where quiescent settling occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Outlet Zone:</strong> Flow converges upwards to decanting weirs or launders.</li>
<li><strong>Sludge Zone:</strong> Collects settled material and moves it towards sludge hoppers for withdrawal.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design of Horizontal Flow Sedimentation Tank</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Design assumptions include:</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Particles settle in the same way as in a quiescent tank of equal depth.</li>
<li>Flow of water is steady and velocity is uniform in the settling zone.</li>
<li>Sediment is uniformly distributed at the inlet zone.</li>
<li>Particles reaching the sludge zone are removed and do not rise.
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Surface Overflow Rate (SOR):</strong> Discharge per unit plan area of a sedimentation tank, expressed in m&sup3;/m&sup2;/day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relation between Settling Velocity and SOR:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The efficiency of a sedimentation tank in removing particles depends on the relationship between the settling velocity of the particles and the surface overflow rate (SOR).</p>
<p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Settling Velocity</strong><strong>:</strong> The speed at which a particle settles to the bottom of the tank due to gravity.</p>
<p><strong>Surface Overflow Rate (SOR):</strong> The rate at which water flows over the surface area of the tank, expressed in m&sup3;/m&sup2;/day.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uniform Flow:</strong> In an ideal sedimentation tank, water flows uniformly, and particles settle at a constant velocity.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Particles with a settling velocity equal to or greater than the SOR will settle and be removed from the water.</p>
<p>Calculation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where ( Q ) is the discharge (flow rate) and ( A ) is the surface area of the tank.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Sedimentation Tanks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sedimentation tanks are designed to remove suspended particles from water by allowing them to settle. They can be classified into two main types:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fill and Draw Type</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Operation:</strong> Raw water is filled into the tank, retained until particles settle, then clear water is drawn off, and the tank is cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>Detention Period:</strong> Normally 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Labor-intensive, loss of head, multiple tanks required, time-consuming.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Continuous Flow Type</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Operation:</strong> Water is continuously admitted and flows slowly, allowing particles to settle.</p>
<p><strong>Shapes:</strong> Rectangular or circular (sometimes square).</p>
<p><strong>Flow Directions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Horizontal Flow Tanks:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rectangular Tanks (Longitudinal Flow):</strong> Water enters from one side and exits from the opposite side. May include baffles to prolong flow length and prevent short-circuiting.</li>
<li><strong>Circular Tanks (Radial Flow):</strong> Water flows radially outwards from a central inlet.
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Vertical Flow Tanks:</strong> Water enters through a central inlet and flows vertically downwards. Sludge is removed by suction through pipes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configuration of Sedimentation Tank</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Proper design is essential to maximize the removal of suspended materials. Key design considerations include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flow Velocity</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Uniformity:</strong> Flow velocity should be uniform and not exceed 300 mm/min (generally 150-300 mm/min).</p>
<p><strong>Scouring Velocity:</strong> Must be less than the scouring or displacement velocity to prevent settled particles from being lifted.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Detention Period: </strong>The theoretical time water is detained in the tank.</li>
</ol>
<p>Formula:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Flowing Through Period: </strong>The actual time water passes through the tank.</li>
</ol>
<p>Efficiency: Should be at least 30% of the detention period for a well-designed tank.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Surface Overflow Rate (SOR): </strong>Discharge per unit plan area of the sedimentation tank, expressed in m&sup3;/m&sup2;/day. Common Values: 15-30 m&sup3;/m&sup2;/day.</li>
<li><strong>Tank Dimensions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rectangular Tanks:</strong> Effective depth of 2.5-4 m, free board and sludge zone of 0.5-1 m, maximum width of 12 m, length to width ratio of 3-5, and length up to 100 m (commonly not exceeding 30 m).</p>
<p><strong>Circular Tanks:</strong> Diameter less than 60 m (generally less than 30 m).</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Inlet and Outlet Structures</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Inlet Structure:</strong> Designed to distribute water equally and at uniform velocities. A baffle should be constructed across the basin close to the inlet to dissipate inlet velocities and provide uniform flow.</p>
<p><strong>Outlet Structure:</strong> Consists of weirs, notches, orifices, effluent troughs or launders, and outlet pipes. Weir loading up to 288 m&sup3;/day/m is normally adopted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sedimentation with Coagulation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sedimentation with coagulation is a process used to remove very fine suspended particles and colloidal matter from water, which cannot be effectively removed by plain sedimentation. This method involves adding chemicals (coagulants) to raw water to form flocs, which then settle and can be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Coagulation:</strong> The process of adding a coagulant to raw water and mixing it thoroughly to form an insoluble, gelatinous, flocculent precipitate called floc.</p>
<p><strong>Flocculation:</strong> The process of forming flocs from the coagulated particles, which then settle due to their increased weight.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>More complete and rapid removal of suspended particles and colloidal matter.</p>
<p>Universally adopted in major treatment plants, especially when raw water contains suspended solids greater than 50 ppm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chemicals Used as Coagulants</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forms strong, stable flocs.</li>
<li>Relatively cheap and easily available.</li>
<li>Removes color, odor, and taste.</li>
<li>Produces crystal clear water.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires sufficient alkalinity in raw water.</li>
<li>Can lead to permanent hardness and corrosion.</li>
<li>Difficult to manage sludge.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Vertical Flow Flocculator:</strong> Circular tank with paddles on a vertical shaft.</li>
<li><strong>Coagulation Sedimentation Tank:</strong> Combines flocculation and sedimentation.</li>
<li><strong>Dorr Clariflocculator:</strong> Compact unit for feeding, mixing, flocculation, and clarification.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filtration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Filtration is a crucial step in modern water treatment plants, often used to remove small flocs or precipitant particles not eliminated by sedimentation. It involves passing water through a stationary bed of granular medium, typically sand supported by gravel, to retain impurities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Principles of Filtration</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mechanical Straining:</strong> Suspended impurities larger than the voids between sand grains are trapped and removed.</li>
<li><strong>Sedimentation and Adsorption:</strong> Voids between sand grains act as mini sedimentation tanks, settling suspended particles. A gelatinous coating on sand grains helps remove finer particles and bacteria.</li>
<li><strong>Biological Metabolism:</strong> Bacteria in the sand grains break down organic impurities into harmless compounds, forming a layer called &lsquo;dirty skin&rsquo; that aids in further filtration.</li>
<li><strong>Electrolytic Action:</strong> Opposite electric charges between filter media and particles neutralize each other, changing the chemical characteristics of water.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Filters</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Filters are classified based on filtration rate and driving force:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow Sand Filters</li>
<li>Rapid Sand Filters</li>
<li>Pressure Filters</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slow Sand Filters</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>History:</strong> Developed by James Simpson in 1829.</p>
<p><strong>Filtration Rate:</strong> One-twentieth of rapid sand or pressure filters.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Requires large land areas and quantities of sand and gravel. Cleaning involves surface scraping.</p>
<p><strong>Schmutzdecke (</strong><strong>सुरक्षात्मक कम्बल</strong><strong>):</strong> A biologically active layer on the sand surface that helps remove turbidity and pathogens without chemicals.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chlorination Process</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When chlorine is added to water, it undergoes hydrolysis to form hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite ions (OCl⁻). HOCl is a more effective disinfectant than OCl⁻. The effectiveness of chlorine depends on the pH of the water, with HOCl being more prevalent at pH levels between 5 and 7.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chlorine Demand and Residual Chlorine</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chlorine Demand:</strong> The amount of chlorine consumed by organic and inorganic matter in water.</p>
<p><strong>Residual Chlorine:</strong> The amount of chlorine remaining in water after the chlorine demand is met, providing ongoing disinfection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dosage and Contact Period</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dosage:</strong> The amount of chlorine added to water, typically enough to leave about 0.2 mg/L of residual chlorine after a contact period of 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Period:</strong> The time required for chlorine to effectively kill microorganisms, usually around 10 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Chlorine Application</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bleaching Powder (Calcium Hypochlorite):</strong> Used for small-scale applications like swimming pools. It is unstable and requires careful storage.</li>
<li><strong>Chloramines:</strong> Formed by adding ammonia to water before chlorine. Less effective than free chlorine but provides longer-lasting disinfection.</li>
<li><strong>Chlorine Gas or Liquid Chlorine:</strong> Used for large-scale water treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Chlorine Dioxide:</strong> Effective but more complex to use and handle.</li>
<li><strong>Forms of Chlorination</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Chlorination is a key method for disinfecting water, involving the addition of chlorine to kill or neutralize harmful microorganisms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple or Plain Chlorination:</strong> Only chlorine is added to relatively clear raw water (0.5 to 1 ppm).</li>
<li><strong>Pre-chlorination:</strong> Chlorine is added before any treatment to control algae, reduce bacterial load, and improve filtration (0.1 to 0.5 ppm residual chlorine).</li>
<li><strong>Post-chlorination: </strong>Chlorine is added after all treatments, just before distribution (0.1 to 0.2 ppm).</li>
<li><strong>Multiple or Double Chlorination: </strong>Chlorine is added at multiple points, especially for highly contaminated water.</li>
<li><strong>Break Point Chlorination: </strong>Chlorine is added until all chlorine demand is met, achieving free chlorine residual. Effective for removing taste, odor, and ensuring bactericidal effect.</li>
<li><strong>Super Chlorination:</strong> Chlorine is added beyond the break point, used during epidemics (2 to 3 mg/L).</li>
<li><strong>De-chlorination:</strong> Excess chlorine is removed to avoid taste issues, using methods like aeration or adding chemicals.</li>
<li><strong>Factors Affecting Chlorination Efficiency</strong></li>
<li><strong>Turbidity: </strong>High turbidity can protect microorganisms from chlorine.</li>
<li><strong>Metallic Compounds: </strong>Metals like iron and manganese react with chlorine.</li>
<li><strong>Ammonia Compounds:</strong> Form less effective chloramines.</li>
<li><strong>pH Value: </strong>Chlorine is more effective at lower pH levels.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Higher temperatures increase disinfection rate.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Time:</strong> Longer contact time improves effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Microorganism Type and Concentration:</strong> Different microorganisms have varying resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Water Softening</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water softening is the process of removing calcium (Ca&sup2;⁺) and magnesium (Mg&sup2;⁺) ions, which cause water hardness. Here&rsquo;s a brief overview:</p>
<p><strong>Types of Hardness</strong></p>
<p><strong>Temporary Hardness:</strong> Caused by bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium.</p>
<p><strong>Permanent Hardness:</strong> Caused by sulfates and chlorides of calcium and magnesium.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removing Temporary Hardness</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Heating water precipitates calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) and magnesium carbonate (MgCO₃), which can be removed by sedimentation.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p>Reaction:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Zeolite Process (Base Exchange):</strong> Hard water is passed through a bed of zeolite (sodium aluminum silicate), which exchanges sodium ions for calcium and magnesium ions.</li>

<li><strong>Methods of Aeration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Aeration is the process of bringing water into intimate contact with air to remove dissolved gases, oxidize dissolved metals, and improve water quality. Here are the main methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Free Fall or Gravity Aerators</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cascade Aerator:</strong> Water flows over a series of steps, creating thin sheets that increase air contact.</p>
<p><strong>Inclined Apron or Riffle Plate Aerators:</strong> Water flows down an inclined surface, breaking into sheets for aeration.</p>
<p><strong>Tray Aerator:</strong> Water falls through a series of trays, each intercepting the flow to enhance aeration.</p>
<p><strong>Gravel Packed Bed Aerator:</strong> Water percolates through beds of coke, limestone, or anthracite, with air blown from below.</p>
<p><strong>Trickling Bed Aerator:</strong> Similar to gravel bed aerators, using trays filled with coke or stone to aerate water.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Spray Aerator</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Water is sprayed through nozzles into the air, breaking into droplets. This method is efficient for removing CO₂ and H₂S.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Diffuse Air Aerator</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Compressed air is blown through perforated pipes at the bottom of a tank, creating bubbles that rise and aerate the water.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Mechanical Aeration</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A propeller connected to a motor mixes air into the water, achieving aeration through mechanical agitation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removal of Color, Odor, and Taste</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Impurities in water can cause undesirable color, odor, and taste. These can be removed by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aeration:</strong> Brings water into contact with air to remove volatile substances.</li>
<li><strong>Activated Carbon Process:</strong> Uses activated carbon to adsorb organic contaminants.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Copper Sulphate: </strong>Controls algae growth and removes color, odor, and taste. Common dose: 0.3 to 0.65 mg/L.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Removal of Iron and Manganese</strong></p>
<p>Iron and manganese in water can be objectionable if their concentration exceeds 0.3 mg/L. They can be removed by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aeration: </strong>Oxidizes iron and manganese, forming insoluble precipitates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reactions:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Adding Lime:</strong> Precipitates iron and manganese as hydroxides.</li>
<li><strong>Manganese Zeolite:</strong> Filters water through manganese-coated zeolite to remove iron and manganese.</li>
<li><strong>RESERVOIR AND DISTRIBUTION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Water distribution involves delivering purified water to consumers through a network of pipes, reservoirs, pumps, valves, and meters. The goal is to provide safe, adequate, and reliable water supply while minimizing losses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirements of a Good Distribution System</strong></li>
<li>Deliver adequate water at required pressure.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> No need for private storage, fresh water always available, useful for firefighting.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages: </strong>Potential for water wastage, requires metering to control usage, interruptions during maintenance.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Intermittent Supply:</strong> Water is supplied at fixed hours.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Useful when water availability is limited, less wastage during non-supply hours.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Requires private storage, inconvenient for consumers, potential for contamination during non-supply hours, requires more valves and larger pipes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Water Reservoirs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Store treated water before distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity: </strong>Typically 14 to 16 hours of average daily flow.</li>
<li><strong>Construction:</strong> Often half below ground and half above, with multiple compartments for maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Service/Distribution Reservoirs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Purpose: </strong>Provide storage to meet demand fluctuations, firefighting, emergencies, and stabilize pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Location: </strong>Near the area served to minimize head loss and save on pipeline costs.</li>
<li><strong>Construction: </strong>Can be made of stone masonry, brick masonry, plain cement concrete, or reinforced concrete. Always covered to avoid contamination and prevent algal growth.

<li><strong>Surface Reservoirs:</strong> Constructed at or below ground level. Used to lift water to elevated reservoirs or supply directly if located at higher elevations.</li>
<li><strong>Elevated Reservoirs:</strong> Also known as overhead tanks, constructed above ground. Common shapes include rectangular, circular, elliptical, spherical, and egg-shaped.</li>
<li><strong>Standpipes: </strong>Vertical cylindrical tanks made of steel or RCC, used to increase pressure in the distribution system.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Capacity of Service Reservoirs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Balancing Reserve:</strong> To meet fluctuating demand with constant pumping. Determined using hydrograph or mass curve methods.</li>
<li><strong>Breakdown Storage:</strong> For emergencies like pump failures or repairs. Typically 25% of total capacity or 1.5 to 2 times the average hourly supply.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Storage: </strong>To provide water for firefighting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculated using the formula:</p>
<p>FR: Fire reserve (Liters)</p>
<p>F: Fire demand (liters/minute)</p>
<p>P: Reserve for pumping capacity (liters/minute)</p>

<li><strong>Layout of Distribution System</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water distribution systems can be laid out in various configurations to efficiently deliver water to consumers. Here are the main types:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dead-End or Tree System: </strong>Main pipeline runs through the center, with sub-mains branching off and further dividing into smaller branches.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages: </strong>Simple design, easy to calculate discharge and pressure, economical.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Sediment accumulation at dead ends, less effective pressure maintenance, low water availability for firefighting.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Grid-Iron or Reticulation System: </strong>Main pipeline runs through the center, with sub-mains and branches interconnected in a grid pattern.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> No sediment stagnation, minimal head loss, small area affected during repairs, better firefighting water availability.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Requires more cutoff valves and longer pipes, complex design and calculations.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Circular or Ring System</strong>: Main pipeline forms a closed ring around the area, with sub-mains running inside.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages: </strong>Water can be supplied from multiple directions, large water availability for firefighting.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages: </strong>Longer pipe lengths, similar merits and demerits as the grid-iron system.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Radial System</strong>: Area is divided into zones, each with a central distribution reservoir. Water flows radially from the center.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Ensures high pressure, quick and efficient distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Requires more reservoirs, similar merits and demerits as the grid-iron system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design of Distribution System</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Designing a distribution system involves both hydraulic and structural considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Pipe Hydraulics</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Continuity Equation: </strong>Ensures mass flow conservation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>☺</strong>Larger pipe size decreases velocity, smaller pipe size increases velocity and head loss.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Bernoulli&rsquo;s Equation: </strong>Ensures energy conservation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>☺</strong>Used to calculate total energy at different points in the system, accounting for head loss.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Head Losses in Pipes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When water flows through pipes, it loses energy due to various factors. These losses are categorized into major and minor losses.</p>
