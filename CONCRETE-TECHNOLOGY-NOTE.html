<strong>concrete:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 35px;">Concrete is a mixture of binding material, aggregates and water in a definate proportion.</p>
<strong>Types of concrete:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 35px;"><STRONG>1. Cement concrete:</STRONG> It is a mixture of cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates and 
water in a definite proportion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 35px;"><STRONG>2. Lime concrete:</STRONG> Here binding material is lime (CaO)</P>
    <p style="margin-left: 35px;"><STRONG>3: RCC:</STRONG> Steel reinforcing is done in the Cement Concrete. </P>
        <p style="margin-left: 35px;"><STRONG>4: Prestressed cement concrete:</STRONG>This concrete is a form of concrete used in construction which is "pre-stressed" by 
            being placed under compression prior to supporting any loads beyond its own dead 
            weight. This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength "tendons" 
            located within or adjacent to the concrete volume, and is done to improve the 
            performance of the concrete in service</p>
            <STRONG>Uses of concrete:</STRONG>
            <p style="margin-left: 35px;">Many structural elements like footings, columns, beams, chejjas, lintels, roofs are made 
                with R.C.C. Cement concrete is used for making storage structures like water tanks, 
                bins, silos, bunkers etc. Bridges, dams, retaining walls are R.C.C. structures in which 
                concrete is the major ingradienting storage structures like water tanks, bins, silos, 
                bunkers etc.</P>
                <strong>.Benefits of concrete:</strong>
                <p style="margin-left: 35px;">There are numerous positive aspects of concrete:<br>
                    1. It is a relatively cheap material and has a relatively long life with few maintenance requirements.<br>
                    2. It is strong in compression<br>
                    3. Before it hardens it is a very pliable substance that can easily be shaped.<br>
4. It is non-combustible
            </p>
            <strong>Limitations of concrete:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 35px;">The limitations of concrete include:<br>
                1.Relatively low tensile strength when compared to other building materials.<br>
                2. Low ductility.<br>
                3. Low strength-to-weight ratio.<br>
                4. It is susceptible to cracking</p>

<strong>Cement:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 35px;">
cement is a binding material used in the masonry.</p>
<strong>Physical Properties of Cement</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 35px;">
Different blends of cement used in construction are characterized by their physical properties.
Some key parameters control the quality of cement. The physical properties of good cement
are based on:<br><ol style="margin-left: 60px;">
<li>Fineness of cement
    <li>Soundness</li>
        <li>Consistency</li>
            <li>Strength</li>
                <li>Setting time</li>
                    <li>Heat of hydration</li>
                        <li>Loss of ignition</li>
                            <li>Bulk density</li>
                                <li>Specific gravity (Relative density)</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 35px;"><strong>Test names associated with these physical properties.</strong> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>1. Fineness of Cement</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 75px;">The size of the particles of the cement is its fineness. The required fineness of good cement is
achieved through grinding the clinker in the last step of cement production process. As
hydration rate of cement is directly related to the cement particle size, fineness of cement is
very important.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>2. Soundness of Cement</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 75px;">It refers to the ability of cement to not shrink upon hardening. Good quality cement retains its
volume after setting without delayed expansion, which is caused by excessive free lime and magnesia.<br>
Tests: Unsoundness of cement may appear after several years, so tests for ensuring soundness must be able to
determine that potential.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Le Chatelier Test</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">This method, done by using Le Chatelier Apparatus, tests the expansion of cement due to lime. Cement
paste (normal consistency) is taken between glass slides and submerged in water for 24 hours at 20+1*C.
It is taken out to measure the distance between the indicators and then returned under water, brought
to boil in 25-30 mins and boiled for an hour. After cooling the device, the distance between indicator
points is measured again. In a good quality cement, the distance should not exceed 10 mm.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>3.Consistency of Cement</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 75px;">The ability of cement paste to flow is consistency. It is measured by Vicat Test.
In Vicat Test Cement paste of normal consistency is taken in the Vicat Apparatus. The plunger of the
apparatus is brought down to touch the top surface of the cement. The plunger will penetrate the
cement up to a certain depth depending on the consistency. A cement is said to have a normal
consistency when the plunger penetrates 10±1 mm.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>4. Strength of cement</strong>
    <p style="margin-left: 75px;">Three types of strength of cement are measured - compressive, tensile and flexural. Various factors
affect the strength, such as water-cement ratio, cement-fine aggregate ratio, curing conditions, size and
shape of a specimen, the manner of molding and mixing, loading conditions and age. While testing the
strength, the following should be considered:<br>
Cement mortar strength and cement concrete strength are not directly related. Cement strength
is merely a quality control measure.<br>
The tests of strength are performed on cement mortar mix, not on cement paste.
Cement gains strength over time, so the specific time of performing the test should be
mentioned.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>5. Compressive Strength</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 75px;">
It is the most common strength test. A test specimen (50mm) is taken and subjected to a compressive
load until failure. The loading sequence must be within 20 seconds and 80 seconds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Tensile strength</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Though this test used to be common during the early years of cement production, now it does not offer any useful
information about the properties of cement.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Flexural strength</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">This is actually a measure of tensile strength in bending. The test is performed in a 40 x40 x 160 mm
cement mortar beam, which is loaded at its center point until failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>6. Setting Time of Cement</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 75px;">Cement sets and hardens when water is added. This setting time can vary depending on multiple
factors, such as fineness of cement, cement-water ratio, chemical content, and admixtures. Cement
used in construction should have an initial setting time that is not too low and a final setting time not
too high. Hence, two setting times are measured:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>
Initial set: </strong> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">It is the time taken by cement paste to start hardening after mixing with water.<br>
During this period, the cement remains in a plastic state and can be molded into any shape.<br>
<h4 style="margin-left: 200px;">Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC): Minimum 30 minutes .<br>
Rapid Hardening Cement: Around 5-10 minutes.</h4></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Final set:</strong> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"> It is the time taken by cement paste to completely harden and gain sufficient strength.
    After this time, the structure can bear loads without deformation.<br>
       <strong> Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC): Maximum 600 minutes (10 hours) </strong></p>
       <p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>7. Heat of Hydration</strong></p>
       <p style="margin-left: 75px;"> When water is added to cement, the reaction that takes place is called hydration. Hydration generates
       heat, which can affect the quality of the cement and also be beneficial in maintaining curing
       temperature during cold weather. On the other hand, when heat generation is high, especially in large
       structures, it may cause undesired stress. The heat of hydration is affected most by C<sub>3</sub>S and C<sub>3</sub>A present
       in cement, and also by water-cement ratio, fineness and curing temperature. The heat of hydration of
       Portland cement is calculated by determining the difference between the dry and the partially hydrated
       cement (obtained by comparing these at 7<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> days).</p>

       
       <p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>8. Loss of Ignition</strong></p>
       <p style="margin-left: 75px;">Heating a cement sample at 900 - 1000°C (that is, until a constant weight is obtained) causes weight
       loss. This loss of weight upon heating is calculated as loss of ignition. Improper and
       prolonged storage or adulteration during transport or transfer may lead to pre-hydration and
       carbonation, both of which might be indicated by increased loss of ignition.</p>
       <p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>      9. Bulk density</strong></p>
       <p style="margin-left: 75px;">When cement is mixed with water, the water replaces areas where there would normally be air. Because
       of that, the bulk density of cement is not very important. Cement has a varying range of density
       depending on the cement composition percentage. The density of cement may be anywhere from 62 to
       78 pounds per cubic foot.</p>
       <p style="margin-left: 55px;"><strong>10. Specific Gravity (Relative Density)</strong></p>
       <p style="margin-left: 75px;">Specific gravity is generally used in mixture proportioning calculations. Portland cement has a specific
       gravity of 3.15, but other types of cement (for example, portland-blast-furnace-slag and portland-
       pozzolan cement) may have specific gravities of about 2.90.</p>
       
<strong>Chemical Properties of Cement</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 55px;">
The raw materials for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand or clay (silicon), bauxite
(aluminum) and iron ore, and may include shells, chalk, marl, shale, clay, blast furnace slag, slate.
Chemical analysis of cement raw materials provides insight into the chemical properties of cement.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>1. Tricalcium aluminate (C<sub>3</sub>A)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Low content of C<sub>3</sub>A makes the cement sulfate-resistant. Gypsum reduces the hydration of C3A, which
liberates a lot of heat in the early stages of hydration. C<sub>3</sub>A does not provide any more than a little
amount of strength.<br>
Type I cement: contains up to 3.5% S0<sub>3</sub> (in cement having more than 8%  C<sub>3</sub>A)<br>
 Type II cement: contains up to 3% SO<sub>3</sub> (in cement having less than 8%  C<sub>3</sub>A)</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>2. Tricalcium silicate (C<sub>3</sub>S)</strong></p>
 <p style="margin-left: 100px;">C<sub>3</sub>S causes rapid hydration as well as hardening and is responsible for the cement's early
strength gain an initial setting.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>3. Dicalcium silicate (C<sub>2</sub>S)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">As opposed to tricalcium silicate, which helps early strength gain, dicalcium silicate in cement helps
the strength gain after one week.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>4. Ferrite (C<sub>4</sub>AF)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Ferrite is a fluxing agent. It reduces the melting temperature of the raw materials in the kiln from
3,000°F to 2,600°F. Though it hydrates rapidly, it does not contribute much to the strength of the
cement.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>5. Magnesia (MgO)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">The manufacturing process of Portland cement uses magnesia as a raw material in dry process plants.
An excess amount of magnesia may make the cement unsound and expansive, but a little amount of it
can add strength to the cement. Production of MgO-based cement also causes less CO<sub>2</sub> emission. All
cement is limited to a content of 6% MgO.</p>
    
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>7. Iron oxide/ Ferric oxide</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Aside from adding strength and hardness, iron oxide or ferric oxide is mainly responsible for the color of
the cement.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>8. Alkalis</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">The amounts of potassium oxide (K<sub>2</sub>O) and sodium oxide (Na<sub>2</sub>0) determine the alkali content of the
cement. Cement containing large amounts of alkali can cause some difficulty in regulating the setting
time of cement. Low alkali cement, when used with calcium chloride in concrete, can cause
discoloration. In slag-lime cement, ground granulated blast furnace slag is not hydraulic on its own but
is "activated" by addition of alkalis. There is an optional limit in total alkali content of 0.60%,
calculated by the equation Na<sub>2</sub>0 + 0.658 K<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>9. Free lime</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Free lime, which is sometimes present in cement, may cause expansion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>10. Silica fumes</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Silica fume is added to cement concrete in order to improve a variety of properties, especially
compressive strength, abrasion resistance and bond strength. Though setting time is prolonged by the
addition of silica fume, it can grant exceptionally high strength. Hence, Portland cement containing 5-
20% silica fume is usually produced for Portland cement projects that require high strength.
Cement containing high alumina has the ability to withstand frigid temperatures since alumina is
chemical-resistant. It also quickens the setting but weakens the cement.</p>


<strong>Aggregates:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 55px;">Aggregates are the important constituents of the concrete which give body to the concrete and also
reduce shrinkage. Aggregates occupy 70 to 80% of total volume of concrete. So, we can say that one
should know definitely about the aggregates in depth to study more about concrete.</p>
<strong>Classification of Aggregates as per Size and Shape</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>1.Classification of Aggregates Based on Shape</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">We know that aggregate is derived from naturally occurring rocks by blasting or crushing etc., so,
it is difficult to attain required shape of aggregate. But, the shape of aggregate will affect the
workability of concrete. So, we should take care about the shape of aggregate. This care is not
only applicable to parent rock but also to the crushing machine used.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong> 2.Classified Of Aggregate according to shape into the following types</strong></p>
<ol style="margin-left: 120px;">
    <li>Rounded aggregates</li>
        <li>Irregular or partly rounded aggregates</li>
            <li>Angular aggregates</li>
                <li>Flaky aggregates</li>
                    <li>Elongated aggregates</li>
                        <li>Flaky and elongated aggregates</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Rounded Aggregate</strong></p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">The rounded aggregates are completely shaped by attrition and available in the form of seashore
gravel. Rounded aggregates result the minimum percentage of voids (32-33%) hence gives more
workability. They require lesser amount of water-cement ratio. They are not considered for high
strength concrete because of poor interlocking behavior and weak bond strength.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Irregular Aggregates</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">The irregular or partly rounded aggregates are partly shaped by attrition and these are available in the 
form of pit sands and gravel. Irregular aggregates may result 35- 37% of voids. These will give lesser 
workability when compared to rounded aggregates. The bond strength is slightly higher than rounded 
aggregates but not as required for high strength concrete</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Angular Aggregates</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">The angular aggregates consist well defined edges formed at the intersection of roughly planar surfaces 
and these are obtained by crushing the rocks.
Angular aggregates result maximum percentage of voids (38-45%) hence gives less workability. They 
give 10-20% more compressive strength due to development of stronger aggregate-mortar bond. So, 
these are useful in high strength concrete manufacturing.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Flaky Aggregates</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">When the aggregate thickness is small when compared with width and length of that aggregate it 
is said to be flaky aggregate. Or in the other, when the least dimension of aggregate is less than 
the 60% of its mean dimension then it is said to be flaky aggregate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Elongated Aggregates</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">When the length of aggregate is larger than the other two dimensions then it is called elongated 
aggregate or the length of aggregate is greater than 180% of its mean dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Flaky and Elongated Aggregates</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">When the aggregate length is larger than its width and width is larger than its thickness then it is said to 
be flaky and elongated aggregates. The above 3 types of aggregates are not suitable for concrete 
mixing. These are generally obtained from the poorly crushed rocks. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>3.Classification of Aggregates Based on Size</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Aggregates are available in nature in different sizes. The size of aggregate used may be related to the 
mix proportions, type of work etc. the size distribution of aggregates is called grading of aggregates.
Following are the classification of aggregates based on size:<br>
o Fine aggregate<br>
o Coarse aggregate</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Fine Aggregate</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">When the aggregate is sieved through 4.75mm sieve, the aggregate passed through it called as 
fine aggregate. Natural sand is generally used as fine aggregate, silt and clay are also come 
under this category. The soft deposit consisting of sand, silt and clay is termed as loam. The 
purpose of the fine aggregate is to fill the voids in the coarse aggregate and to act as a
workability agent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Coarse Aggregate</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">When the aggregate is sieved through 4.75mm sieve, the aggregate retained is called coarse 
    aggregate. Gravel, cobble and boulders come under this category. The maximum size aggregate used 
    may be dependent upon some conditions. In general, 40mm size aggregate used for normal
    strengths and 20mm size is used for high strength concrete. </p>
   <strong>Bulking of Sand</strong>
   <p style="margin-left: 55px;"> The increase in moisture of sand increases the volume of sand. The reason is that moisture causes film
    of water around sand particles which results in the increase of volume of sand. For a moisture content
    percentage of 5 to 8 there will be an increase in volume up to 20 to 40 percent depending upon sand. If the
    sandisfinertherewillbemoreincreaseinvolume. This is known as bulking of sand.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 55px;">
    When the moisture content of sand is increased by adding more water, the sand particles pack near each other and the 
    amount of bulking of sand is decreased. Thus, it helps in determining the actual volume of sand, the dry sand and the sand 
    completely filled with water will have the exact volume.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 55px;">The volumetric proportioning of sand is greatly affected by bulking of sand to a greater extent. The 
    affected volume will be great for fine sand and will be less for coarse sand. If proper allowance is not 
    made for the bulking of sand, the cost of concrete and mortar increases and it results into under-sanded 
    mixes which are harsh and difficult for working and placing.</p>
<strong>    SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND WATER ABSORPTION TEST</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 55px;">
i) To measure the strength or quality of the material <br>ii) To determine 
the water absorption of aggregates</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>APPARATUS:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">The apparatus consists of the following<br>
(a) A balance of capacity about 3kg, to weigh accurate 0.5g, and of such a type and shape as to 
permit weighing of the sample container when suspended in water.<br>
(b) A thermostatically controlled oven to maintain temperature at 100-110° C.<br>
(c) A wire basket of not more than 6.3 mm mesh or a perforated container of convenient size with 
thin wire hangers for suspending it from the balance. <br>
(d) A container for filling water and suspending the basket<br>
(e) An air tight container of capacity similar to that of the basket<br>
(f) A shallow tray and two absorbent clothes, each not less than 75x45cm.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>THEORY:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">The specific gravity of an aggregate is considered to be a measure of strength or quality of the material. 
Stones having low specific gravity are generally weaker than those with higher specific gravity values.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>PROCEDURE:</strong><br>
    <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(i) About 2 kg of aggregate sample is washed thoroughly to remove fines, drained and placed in wire 
basket and immersed in distilled water at a temperature between 22- 32º C and a cover of at least 
5cm of water above the top of basket.<br>
(ii) Immediately after immersion the entrapped air is removed from the sample by lifting the basket 
containing it 25 mm above the base of the tank and allowing it to drop at the rate of about one drop 
per second. The basket and aggregate should remain completely immersed in water for a period of 24 
hour afterwards.<br>
(iii) The basket and the sample are weighed while suspended in water at a temperature of 22° –
32°C. The weight while suspended in water is noted
=W<sub>1</sub>g.<br>
(iv) The basket and aggregates are removed from water and allowed to drain for a few minutes, 
after which the aggregates are transferred to the dry absorbent clothes. The empty basket is then 
returned to the tank of water jolted 25 times and weighed in water=W<sub>2</sub>g. .<br>
(v) The aggregates placed on the absorbent clothes are surface dried till no further moisture could be 
removed by this cloth. Then the aggregates are transferred to the second dry cloth spread in single 
layer and allowed to dry for at least 10 minutes until the aggregates are completely surface dry. The 
surface dried aggregate is then weighed =W<sub>3</sub> g<br>
(vi) The aggregate is placed in a shallow tray and kept in an oven maintained at a temperature of 
110° C for 24 hrs. It is then removed from the oven, cooled in an air tight container and

       <strong> Hydration of Cement</strong>
       <p style="margin-left: 55px;">
               Portland cement is a hydraulic cement; hence it derives its strength from chemical reactions
        between the cement and water. The process is known as hydration.<br>
        Cement consists of the following major compounds :<br>
    
        1.Tricalcium silicate, C<sub>3</sub>S<br>
        2.Dicalcium silicate, C₂S<br>
        3.Tricalcium aluminate, C<sub>3</sub>A<br>
                4.Tetra calcium aluminoferrite, C.AF<br>
    
        5.Gypsum, CSH:</p>
        <strong>Water-cement ratio</strong>
        <p style="margin-left: 55px;">The water-cement ratio is the ratio of the weight of water to the weight of cement used in
        a concrete mix. A lower ratio leads to higher strength and durability, but may make the mix difficult to
        work with and form. Workability can be resolved with the use of plasticizers or super-plasticizers.
        Often, the ratio refers to the ratio of water to cement plus pozzolan ratio, w/(c+p). The pozzolan is
        typically a fly ash, or blast furnace slag. It can include a number of other materials, such as silica
        fume, rice husk ash or natural pozzolans. Pozzolans can be added to strengthen concrete.</p>
        <strong>Duff Abrams' law</strong>
        <p style="margin-left: 55px;">The notion of water-cement ratio was first developed by Duff A. Abrams and published in 1918.
        Concrete hardens as a result of the chemical reaction between cement and water (known
                        as hydration, this produces heat and is called the heat of hydration). For every pound (or kilogram or
        any unit of weight) of cement, about 0.35 pounds (or 0.35 kg or corresponding unit) of water is needed
        to fully complete hydration reactions.<br>
        However, a mix with a ratio of 0.35 may not mix thoroughly, and may not flow well enough to be
        placed. More water is therefore used than is technically necessary to react with cement. Water-
        cement ratios of 0.45 to 0.60 are more typically used. For higher-strength concrete, lower ratios
        are used, along with a plasticizer to increase flowability.
        Too much water will result in segregation of the sand and aggregate components from the cement
        paste</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Effect of Water Cement Ratio on Strength of Concrete:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;">The water-cement ratio is one of the most important aspect when it comes to maintaining the strength
        of Concrete. The ratio depends on the grade of concrete and the structure size. We generally prefer a
        W/C ratio of 0.4 to 0.6, but it can be decreased in case of high-grade concrete, we reduce the amount
        of water and use plasticizers instead.<br>
        W/C ratio affects the workability of concrete and thus should be taken into careful consideration. Also, if
        the ratio exceeds the normal value, segregation of concrete occurs and the coarse aggregate settles at
        the bottom, thus affecting the strength of concrete greatly.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Limitation of Water Cement Law:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 130px;">
        1. The internal moisture condition of hydration of cement continues till the concrete gain full
        strength.<br>
        2. The concrete specimen is cured under standard temperatures.<br>
        3. The concrete specimens should of same size.<br>
        4. The concrete specimens should of same age.<br></p>

            <div class="card">
                     <strong>  Workability</strong>
                     <p style="margin-left: 55px;"> Workability is defined as the amount of energy required to overcome internal friction and cause
        complete compaction. Workability is completely depending upon the properties of various ingredients of concrete.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Factors Affecting Workability</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;">1.Cement content of concrete<br>
        2.Water content of concrete Mix<br>
        3.proportions of concrete <br>
        4.Size of aggregates<br>
        5.Shape of aggregates<br>
        6.Grading of aggregates<br>
        7.Surface texture of aggregates<br>
        8. Use of admixtures in concrete<br>
        9.Use of supplementary cementitious materials</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong> Following are the general factors affecting concrete workability:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong> 1. Cement Content of Concrete</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 150px;">Cement content affects the workability of concrete in good measure. More the quantity of cement, the
        more will be the paste available to coat the surface of aggregates and fill the voids between them. This
        will help to reduce the friction between aggregates and smooth movement of aggregates during mixing,
        transporting, placing and compacting of concrete.<br>
   
Also, for a given water-cement ratio, the increase in the cement content will also increase the water
content per unit volume of concrete increasing the workability of concrete. Thus, increase in cement
content of concrete also increases the workability of concrete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong>2. Type and Composition of Cement</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">There are also affect of type of cement or characteristics of cement on the workability of concrete. The
cement with increase in fineness will require more water for same workability than the comparatively
less fine cement. The water demand increased for cement with high Al203 or C2S contents.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong> 3. Water/Cement Ratio or Water Content of Concrete</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Water/cement ratio is one of the most important factors which influence the concrete workability.
Generally, a water cement ratio of 0.45 to 0.6 is used for good workable concrete without the use of
any admixture. Higher the water/cement ratio, higher will be the water content per volume of concrete
and concrete will be more workable.<br>
Higher water/cement ratio is generally used for manual concrete mixing to make the mixing process
easier. For machine mixing, the water/cement ratio can be reduced. These generalized method of
using water content per volume of concrete is used only for nominal mixes.<br>
For designed mix concrete, the strength and durability of concrete is of utmost importance and hence
water cement ratio is mentioned with the design. Generally designed concrete uses low water/cement
ratio so that desired strength and durability of concrete can be achieved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong> 4. Mix Proportions of Concrete</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Mix proportion of concrete tells us the ratio of fine aggregates and coarse aggregates
w.r.t. cement quantity. This can also be called as the aggregate cement ratio of concrete. The more
cement is used, concrete becomes richer and aggregates will have proper lubrications for easy mobility
or flow of aggregates.<br>
The low quantity of cement w.r.t. aggregates will make the less paste available for aggregates and
mobility of aggregates is restrained.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong> 5. Size of Aggregates</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Surface area of aggregates depends on the size of aggregates. For a unit volume of aggregates with
large size, the surface area is less compared to same volume of aggregates with small sizes.<br>

When the surface area increases, the requirement of cement quantity also increases to cover up the
entire surface of aggregates with paste. This will make more use of water to lubricate each aggregate.
Hence, lower sizes of aggregates with same water content are less workable than the large size
aggregates.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong> 6. Shape of Aggregates</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">The shape of aggregates affects the workability of concrete. It is easy to understand that rounded
aggregates will be easy to mix than elongated, angular and flaky aggregates due to less frictional
resistance.<br>
Other than that, the round aggregates also have less surface area compared to elongated or irregular
shaped aggregates. This will make less requirement of water for same workability of concrete. This is
why river sands are commonly preferred for concrete as they are rounded in shape.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong> 7. Grading of Aggregates</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Grading of aggregates have the maximum effect on the workability of concrete. A well graded
aggregates have all sizes in required percentages. This helps in reducing the voids in a given volume of
aggregates.<br>
The less volume of voids makes the cement paste available for aggregate surfaces to provide better
lubrication to the aggregates.<br>
With less volume of voids, the aggregate particles slide past each other and less compacting effort is
required for proper consolidation of aggregates. Thus, low water cement ratio is sufficient for properly
graded aggregates.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong> 8. Surface Texture of Aggregates</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Surface texture such as rough surface and smooth surface of aggregates affects the workability of
concrete in the same way as the shape of aggregates.<br>
With rough texture of aggregates, the surface area is more than the aggregates of same volume with
smooth texture. Thus, concrete with smooth surfaces are more workable than with rough textured
aggregates.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong> 9. Use of Admixtures in Concrete</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">There are many types of admixtures used in concrete for enhancing its properties. There are some
workability enhancer admixtures such as plasticizers and superplasticizers which increases the
workability of concrete even with low water/cement ratio.<br>

They are also called as water reducing concrete admixtures. They reduce the quantity of water
required for same value of slump.<br>
Air entraining concrete admixtures are used in concrete to increase its workability. This admixture
reduces the friction between aggregates by the use of small air bubbles which acts as the ball bearings
between the aggregate particles.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong> Measurement of Workability:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong>Slump Test.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Concrete slump test is to determine the workability or consistency of concrete mix prepared at the
laboratory or the construction site during the progress of the work. Concrete slump test is carried
out from batch to batch to check the uniform quality of concrete during construction. <br>
The slump test is the simplest workability test for concrete, involves low cost and provides immediate
results. Due to this fact, it has been widely used for workability tests since 1922. <br>
Generally concrete slump value is used to find the workability, which indicates water-cement
ratio, but there are various factors including
properties of materials, mixing methods, dosage, admixtures etc. also affect the concrete slump value.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><strong>Factors which influence the concrete slump test:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 180px;">1.Material properties like chemistry, fineness, particle size distribution, moisture content and
temperature of cementitious materials.<br>
2.Size, texture, combined grading, cleanliness and moisture content of the aggregates,<br>
3.Chemical admixtures dosage, type, combination, interaction, sequence of addition and its
effectiveness,<br>
4.Air content of concrete<br>
5.Concrete batching, mixing and transporting methods and equipment,<br>
6.Temperature of the concrete<br>
7.Sampling of concrete, slump-testing technique and the condition of test equipment<br>
8.The amount of free water in the concrete<br>
9.Time since mixing of concrete at the time of testing.</p>

            <strong>TYPES OF CONCRETE MIXES</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 55px;"> <strong>  1.NOMINAL MIX</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 80px;"> <strong>Nominal Mix</strong> refers to a fixed proportion of the ingredients, typically used for concrete preparation. This mix is suitable for small construction works where the exact proportions are not critical. It is used for general-purpose concrete where high precision is not necessary.</p>

                <p>Admixtures are chemicals, added to concrete, mortar or grout at the time of mixing, to modify the properties, either in the wet state immediately after mixing or after the mix has hardened. They can be a single chemical or a blend of several chemicals and may be supplied as powders but most are aqueous solutions because in this form, they are easier to accurately dispense into, and then disperse through the concrete.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Admixtures are ingredients other than basic ingredients cement, water and aggregates that are added to concrete batch immediately before or during mixing to modify one or more of the specific properties of concrete in fresh and hardened state.</li>
        <li>Added in small quantity either in powder or liquid form</li>
        <li>Combination is used when more than one property to be altered.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Categories of Admixtures:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Active materials</strong> are those which react chemically with a component within the Cementations materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Surface active admixtures (surfactants)</strong>: These are generally split into two components (one positively charged and the other negatively charged) and react with the air - water - solid material interface within the mortar thereby resulting in orientation and adsorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Passive or inert admixtures</strong>: These do not change their form but have a physical effect such as light absorption and reflection as in the case of pigments.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>1.Accelerators:</strong>
    <p>Main objective of using accelerators in concrete is to increase speed of setting and hardening.</p>
    <strong>Advantages of using Accelerators:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>To remove formwork quickly</li>
        <li>To reduce the curing time</li>
        <li>To use structure earlier</li>
        <li>To finish the surface fast</li>
        <li>To increase the speed of construction</li>
        <li>For quick repairing work</li>
    </ul>
    <strong style="margin-left: 55px;" >Main Accelerators:</strong>
    <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
        <li>Calcium Chloride (CaCl2)</li>
        <li>Soluble Carbonates</li>
        <li>Silicates</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;">CaCl2 is the most commonly used accelerator in construction. If 2% CaCl2 by weight of cement is added in concrete, then it decreases the setting time from 3 to 1 hour and final setting time from 6 to 2 hours. We can get a two-day strength in 1 day at 21°C temperature. If the proportion of CaCl2 is more than 3% then flash set of concrete takes place, and drying shrinkage and creep will increase.</p>

    <strong>2. Retarders:</strong>
    <p>To decrease the speed of Hydration and setting, Retarders are used in concrete. Retarders make concrete plastic and workable for a long time.</p>
    <strong>Objectives of using Retarders:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>To decrease the setting time</li>
        <li>To increase strength by decreasing W/C Ratio</li>
        <li>To do concreting in hot areas</li>
        <li>For grouting of oil wells</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Main Retarders:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Calcium Sulphate (Gypsum)</li>
        <li>Starches</li>
        <li>Sugars</li>
        <li>Cellulose Products</li>
        <li>Acids or Salts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Gypsum is the most commonly used retarder. Generally, 2 to 3% gypsum is added. We can also use gypsum as a plaster of Paris. By using more gypsum, expansion of concrete will occur, and setting of concrete will be very slow.</p>

    <strong>3. Plasticizers:</strong>
    <p>Workability is the most important property of concrete. Workability of concrete will change according to the situation of construction. For deep beams, light partition walls, beam-column junctions, concrete pumping, tremie concreting, high workable concrete is used. Many times, plasticizers are also known as “Water Reducing Admixture.” Plasticizer increases the workability without adding much water. It decreases the W/C Ratio which increases the strength.</p>
    <strong>Main Plasticizers used in Construction:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Calcium lignosulphonates</li>
        <li>Sodium lignosulphonates</li>
        <li>Ammonium lignosulphonates</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Uses of Plasticizers:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>To achieve a higher strength by decreasing the water-cement ratio at the same workability as an admixture-free mix</li>
        <li>To achieve the same workability by decreasing the cement content to reduce the heat of hydration in mass concrete</li>
        <li>To increase the workability to ease placing in accessible locations</li>
        <li>Water reduction more than 5% but less than 12%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The commonly used admixtures are Ligno-sulphonates and hydrocarbolic acid salts. Plasticizers are usually based on lignosulphonate, which is a natural polymer, derived from wood processing in the paper industry.</p>

    <strong> Effects of Plasticizers on the Properties of Concrete</strong>
    <p>The effect of water-reducing admixtures is dependent on: dosage of the admixture, cement type, aggregate type and grading, mix proportions, and temperature.</p>

    <strong>Workability:</strong>
    <p>Typically, an initial slump in the range 25—75 mm can be increased by 50-60 mm.</p>

    <strong>Compressive Strength:</strong>
    <p>The compressive strength of concrete is increased by using water-reducing admixtures to reduce water content while maintaining workability. The increase in strength is a direct result of the lower water/cement ratio.</p>

    <strong>4. Super Plasticizers:</strong>
    <p>In 1960, Japan made the first Super plasticizer and then in 1970, Germany made it. By using Super Plasticizers, we can reduce 30% of water. It is also called “High Range Water Reducers.” It is a strong dispersing agent.</p>

    <strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Super-plasticizers:</strong>

    <div class="card">
        <strong>Introduction</strong>
        <p>Special concretes are prepared for specific purposes like lightweight, high density, fire protection, and radiation shielding. Concrete is versatile with good compressive strength but suffers from drawbacks like low tensile strength, permeability, and corrosion.</p>
        <p>To overcome these deficiencies, advancements in material and construction technology have improved concrete's performance, making it more economical and durable. Research is ongoing to enhance its mechanical properties, durability, impermeability, and resistance to environmental factors.</p>
        
        <strong>Different Types of Special Concrete:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight Concrete</li>
            <li>High Strength Concrete</li>
            <li>Fibre Reinforced Concrete</li>
            <li>Ferrocement</li>
            <li>Ready Mix Concrete</li>
            <li>Shotcrete</li>
            <li>Polymer Concrete</li>
            <li>High Performance Concrete</li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>Lightweight Concrete</strong>
        <p>Conventional concrete has a density of 2200-2600 kg/m³, making it heavy. Lightweight concrete, with a density of 300-1900 kg/m³, offers advantages like reduced dead load, lower foundation costs, and better thermal insulation.</p>
        
        <strong>Types of Lightweight Aggregates:</strong>
        <strong>Natural Lightweight Aggregates:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pumice:</strong>These are rocks of volcanic origin. They are light coloured 
                or nearly white and has a fairly even texture of interconnected 
                voids.  Its bulk density is (500-800 kg/m³).</li>
            <li><strong>Scoria:</strong> Dark-colored volcanic aggregate, slightly weaker than pumice.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice Husk:</strong> Use of rice husk or groundnut husk has been reported 
                as light weight aggregate.</li>
            <li><strong>Sawdust:</strong> Used in flooring and precast elements but affects cement setting.</li>
            <li><strong>Diatomite:</strong> Derived from aquatic plants, used as a pozzolanic material.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>Artificial Lightweight Aggregates:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sintered Fly Ash:</strong> Made by sintering fly ash at high temperatures (sold as 'Lytag').</li>
            <li><strong>Foamed Slag:</strong> By-product of pig iron production, porous like pumice.</li>
            <li><strong>Bloated Clay:</strong> Formed by heating special clay, expanding due to gas formation.</li>
            <li><strong>Exfoliated Vermiculite:</strong> Expands on heating, used for lightweight insulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Cinders & Clinkers:</strong> Partly fused particles from coal combustion.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>No-Fines Concrete</strong>
        <p>No-fines concrete is made by omitting fine aggregates, using only cement, coarse aggregates, and water. It has a density of 1600-2000 kg/m³ (or as low as 350 kg/m³ with lightweight aggregates). It provides structural efficiency but has low bond strength, requiring pre-coated reinforcement.</p>
        
        <strong>Advantages of Lightweight Concrete:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Smaller structural sections.</li>
            <li>Lower haulage and handling costs.</li>
            <li>Faster construction progress.</li>
            <li>Lower foundation costs, especially on weak soil.</li>
            <li>Better thermal insulation, reducing air-conditioning costs.</li>
            <li>Utilizes industrial waste like fly ash and slag.</li>
            <li>High fire resistance.</li>
            <li>Economic benefits and enhanced seismic performance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>Methods to Achieve Lightweight Concrete:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Using lightweight aggregates.</li>
            <li>Introducing air bubbles (Aerated Concrete).</li>
            <li>Omitting fine aggregates (No-Fines Concrete).</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>High strength concrete</strong>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">High strength concrete can be defined by compressive strength of concrete at 28 days of water curing. When the grade of concrete exceeds M35, then the concrete may be called as high strength concrete.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">In general, producing HSC is difficult with the use of conventional materials like cement, aggregate, and water alone. It can be achieved by using chemical and mineral admixtures or any one of the following methods:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 50px;" >
            <li>Seeding</li>
            <li>Re-vibration</li>
            <li>High speed slurry mixing</li>
            <li>Use of admixtures</li>
            <li>Inhibition of cracks</li>
            <li>Sulphur Impregnation</li>
            <li>Use of cementitious aggregates</li>
        </ol>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">A. Seeding:</strong>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">In this method, a small percentage of finely ground, fully hydrated Portland cement is added to the fresh concrete mix.</p>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">B. Re-vibration:</strong>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">Mixing water creates continuous capillary channels, leading to bleeding and water accumulation. Controlled re-vibration after a suitable time increases the strength of concrete.</p>
    
        <strong  style="margin-left: 80px;">C. High Speed Slurry Mixing:</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 100px;">This process involves advanced preparation of a cement-water mixture, which is then blended with aggregate to produce HSC.</p>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">D. Use of Admixtures:</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 100px;">High strength can be achieved by adding chemical admixtures such as superplasticizers and mineral admixtures like fly ash and silica fume.</p>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">E. Inhibition of Cracks:</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 100px;">Replacing 2-3% of fine aggregate with polythene (0.025 mm thick and 3-4 mm in diameter) acts as a crack arrester, improving strength up to 105 MPa.</p>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">F. Sulphur Impregnation:</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 100px;">Low-strength porous concrete is impregnated with sulphur, increasing strength up to 58 MPa.</p>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">G. Use of Cementitious Aggregates:</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 100px;">Certain clinkers (e.g., ALAG) are used as aggregates, providing high strength up to 125 MPa with a low water-cement ratio of 0.32.</p>
    
        <strong>Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC)</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 50px;">FRC is a composite material consisting of concrete and uniformly dispersed fine fibres. It improves ductility, flexural strength, toughness, impact resistance, and fatigue strength.</p>
    
        <strong  style="margin-left: 50px">Types of Fibres:</strong>
        <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
            <li>Steel Fibre</li>

        <strong  style="margin-left: 80px;">Steel Fibres:</strong>
        <p  Style="margin-left: 100px;">Steel fibres are round and range from 0.25 mm to 0.75 mm in diameter. They significantly improve flexural impact and fatigue strength and are used in overlays, pavements, bridge decks, and flooring.</p>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">Glass Fibres:</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 100px;">Produced as roving, strands, or woven mats, glass fibres are used for decorative rather than structural applications. Alkali-resistant glass fibres have been developed to combat degradation.</p>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">Plastic Fibres:</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 100px;">Fibres like polypropylene, nylon, acrylic, and aramid have high tensile strength, improving impact resistance and reducing crack sizes.</p>
    
        <strong style="margin-left: 80px;">Carbon Fibres:</strong>
        <p Style="margin-left: 100px;">Carbon fibres have high tensile strength and modulus of elasticity. While promising, they are costly and not widely available in India.</p>
        <strong Style="margin-left: 80px;">Asbestos fibers:</strong>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">Asbestos is a mineral fibre and has proved to be most successful fibre, which can be mixed with OPC. The maximum length of asbestos fibre is 10 mm but generally fibers are shorter than this. The composite has high flexural strength.</p>
        
        <strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Factors Affecting Properties of Fiber Reinforced Concrete</strong>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">The important factors affecting properties of FRC are as follows:</p>

            <li>Minimizes human error and reduces labour dependency.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>Shotcrete or Gunite</strong>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Shotcrete is the process of conveying dry (or damp) sand and cement by means of compressed air through a hose to a nozzle where water is added before the material is sprayed on the construction surface.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 50px;">The process of keeping the ingredients of concrete in their proper place to protect them from the effect of weathering is called storing.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 100px;">Maintaining the quality and grading of materials is the main objective of storage of materials. Every effort should be made that the quality of cement does not deteriorate during storage in warehouses or at the site of work.</p>
                
                <strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Storage of cement</strong>
                <p style="margin-left: 100px;">Cement is a finely ground material. It is highly hygroscopic and absorbs moisture, which may be in the form of free water. An absorption of 1 to 2% of water has no effect, but further absorption reduces the strength of cement. If the absorption exceeds 5%, the cement is ruined for ordinary purposes. During storage and transportation, care is taken to keep it away from moisture.</p>

                <strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Storing of Aggregates</strong>
                <p style="margin-left: 100px;">Storing aggregates should ensure uniform grading, prevent segregation, maintain consistent surface water conditions, and avoid mixing with harmful materials.</p>
                
                <strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Precautions for Maintaining Uniformity of Grading</strong>
                <ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
                    <li>Select a hard and dry ground for storing aggregates. If unavailable, provide a platform using planks, G.I. sheets, bricks, or a weak concrete layer.</li>
                    <li>Store aggregates of different sizes separately.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Precautions for Prevention of Segregation</strong>
                <ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
                    <li>Do not drop successive consignments in the same place to avoid segregation.</li>
                    <li>Place aggregates in layers not thicker than one truckload.</li>
                    <li>Avoid dropping aggregates from heights during transportation.</li>
                    <li>Store aggregates close to the mixer to minimize transport distance.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Precautions for Preserving Uniformity of Moisture Content</strong>
                <ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
                    <li>Piles should be large and 1.25m to 1.75m in height.</li>
                    <li>Allow piles to stand for at least 24 hours before use to let moisture settle.</li>
                    <li>Avoid using the bottom 300mm of sand piles as they become saturated.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Precautions for Cleanliness of Aggregates</strong>
                <p style="margin-left: 100px;">Keep aggregate piles free of leaves, debris, and animal refuse.</p>
                <strong>STORING OF WATER</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Water is stored at site in a masonry tank built for the purpose or in other clean containers. The walls of the tank should be somewhat higher than the surrounding ground. Sufficient quantity of water should be stored in advance to ensure the continuity of concreting operations. If the water obtained from a source contains dust etc., it should be collected a day in advance to allow such suspended impurities to settle down before use.</p>

<strong>BATCHING</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The process of measurement of ingredients (cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate and water) for making concrete is called batching. Batching is done in two ways:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 70px;">
    <li>Volume batching</li>
    <li>Weigh batching</li>
</ul>

<strong style="margin-left: 70px;">Volume batching</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">(a) Batching of cement: Cement is always batched by weight. Cement should never be batched by volume, because its weight per unit volume varies according to the way container (forma) is filled.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">(b) Batching of aggregates: Wooden batch boxes known as formas are used for batching of fine and coarse aggregates by volume. The formas should be made of 30 mm thick timber.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">(c) Batching of water: It is practice in the field to add water by tin cans or buckets. It is not an accurate method. It results in variable strength of concrete. Some of mixers are equipped with calibrated water tank attached permanently to the mixers. For the mixers not provided with water tank, a calibrated syphon system can be easily installed, such as the one used in cisterns of water closets. If, however, there are no such automatic devices, water should be measured in calibrated cans very accurately and then only should be added in the mixer.</p>

<strong style="margin-left: 70px;">Weigh Batching</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Strictly speaking, weigh batching is the correct method of measuring the materials. For important concrete, invariably, weigh batching system should be adopted. Use of weight system in batching facilitates accuracy, flexibility, and simplicity. Different types of weigh batchers are available, the particular type to be used depends upon the nature of the job. Large weigh batching plants have automatic weighing equipment. The use of this automatic equipment for batching is one of sophistication and requires qualified and experienced engineers. In smaller works, the weighing arrangement consists of two weighing buckets, each connected through a system of levers to spring-loaded dials which indicate the load.</p>

<strong >MIXING OF CONCRETE</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The process of mixing of various ingredients of concrete in specified proportions is termed as mixing of concrete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Methods of mixing:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
    <li>Hand mixing</li>
    <li>Machine mixing</li>
</ul>

<strong style="margin-left: 70px;"> HAND MIXING</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">The process of mixing the ingredients of concrete by manual labour is called hand mixing. Hand mixing is adopted for small and unimportant works and where quantity of concrete used is small. Hand mixing method requires more cement (10% more) than machine mixing for obtaining the same strength of concrete.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 100px;">Following is step-wise procedure for mixing by hand:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 150px;">
    <li>A platform of bricks, lean concrete, or iron sheets is constructed. The size of the platform depends upon the quantity of concrete to be mixed at a time.</li>
    <li>Spread out a measured quantity of sand evenly on the mixing platform.</li>
    <li>Spread the cement uniformly on this sand and mix it till the color of the mixture is uniform.</li>
    <li>Spread this mixture evenly again on the platform.</li>
    <li>Spread the measured coarse aggregate evenly on the mixing platform.</li>
    <li>Mix the material dry.</li>
    <li>Make a hollow in the center of the mixed material. After this, 75% of the required quantity of water based on the water-cement ratio is added and then start remixing taking care that no water escapes the mixture.</li>
    <li>The remaining water is added with the continuation of the mixing process.</li>
    <li>Normally mixing time should not exceed 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>The platform should be cleaned at the end of the day's work so that it is ready for use the next day.</li>
</ul>

<strong style="margin-left: 100px;">MACHINE MIXING</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">The process of mixing the ingredients of concrete by a machine is called machine mixing. In this case, where a large quantity of concrete is to be produced, hand mixing becomes costly even if the labor is cheap. The machine mixing becomes essential. The concrete can thus be produced at a faster rate and at a lesser cost. The quality of concrete by machine mixing is also better.</p>



<strong>TRANSPORTATION OF CONCRETE</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The process of carrying concrete mix from the place of its mixing to final position or deposition is called transportation of concrete. Transportation of concrete mix is very important because time is a factor involved. The mix should be transported as quickly as possible.</p>

<strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Precaution in Transportation of Concrete</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;">The following precautions should be taken during transporting concrete from the mixing place:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
    <li>Concrete should be transported as quickly as possible to the formwork within the initial setting time of cement.</li>
    <li>Efforts should be made to prevent segregation.</li>
    <li>Transportation cost should be as low as possible.</li>
    <li>The concrete mix should be protected from drying in hot weather and from rain during transportation.</li>
    <li>The concrete should be kept agitated in truck mixers so that it does not become stiff when transportation is likely to take more time.</li>
    <li>No water should be lost from the mix during transportation.</li>
    <li>The permissible duration of transport of concrete should be determined in the laboratory.</li>
</ul>

<strong style="margin-left: 70px;">Methods Adopted for Transportation of Concrete</strong>
<ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
    <li>Mortar Pan</li>
    <li>Wheel Barrow, Hand Cart</li>
    <li>Crane, Bucket and Rope way</li>
    <li>Truck Mixer and Dumpers</li>
    <li>Belt Conveyors</li>
    <li>Chute</li>
    <li>Skip and Hoist</li>
    <li>Transit Mixer</li>
    <li>Pump and Pipe Line</li>
    <li>Helicopter</li>
</ul>

<strong>Concrete Pumps</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The modern concrete pump is a sophisticated, reliable, and robust machine. In the past, a simple two-stroke mechanical pump consisted of a receiving hopper, an inlet and an outlet valve, a piston, and a cylinder. The pump was powered by a diesel engine.</p>



<strong style="margin-left: 50px;">Choosing the Correct Pump</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;">For choosing the correct pump, one must know the following factors:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
    <li>Length of horizontal pipe</li>
    <li>Length of vertical pipe</li>
    <li>Number of bends</li>
    <li>Diameter of pipeline</li>
    <li>Length of flexible hose</li>
    <li>Changes in line diameter</li>
    <li>Slump of Concrete</li>
</ul>

<strong>Placing Concrete</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">It is not enough that a concrete mix is correctly designed, batched, mixed, and transported. It is of utmost importance that the concrete must be placed in a systematic manner to yield optimum results. The precautions to be taken and methods adopted while placing concrete in the undermentioned situations will be discussed.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
    <li>Placing concrete within earth mould (example: Foundation concrete for a wall or column).</li>
    <li>Placing concrete within large earth mould or timber plank formwork (example: Road slab and airfield slab).</li>
    <li>Placing concrete in layers within timber or steel shutters (example: Mass concrete in dam construction or construction of concrete abutment or pier).</li>
    <li>Placing concrete within usual formwork (example: Columns, beams, and floors).</li>
    <li>Placing concrete under water</li>
</ul>
<strong  style="margin-left: 50px;">Placing Concrete within Earth Mould:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• Concrete is invariable as foundation bed below the walls and columns before placing concrete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• All loose earth must be removed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• Roots of trees must be cut.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• If surface is dry, it should be made damp.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• If it is too wet or rain soaked the water, then slush must be removed.</p>

<strong  style="margin-left: 50px;">Placing Concrete in Layers within Timber or Steel Shutter:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">This can be used in the following cases:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">1. Dam construction</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">2.Construction of concrete abutments</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">3.Raft for a high-rise building</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• The thickness of layers depends on:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">1. Method of compaction</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">2.Size of vibrator</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">3. Frequency of vibrator used</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">It’s better to leave the top of the layer rough so that succeeding layer can have a good bond.</p>

<strong  style="margin-left: 50px;">Placing Concrete within Usual Formwork:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• Adopted for columns, beams, and floors. Rules that should be followed while placing the concrete:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">• Check the reinforcements are correctly tied and placed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">• Mould releasing agent should be applied.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">• The concrete must be placed carefully with a small quantity at a time so that they will not block the entry of subsequent concrete.</p>

<strong  style="margin-left: 50px;">Placing Concrete Underwater:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Concrete having cement content at least 450kg/m<sup>3</sup> and a slump of 10 to 17.5cm can be placed underwater.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Methods:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">1. Bagged method</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">2. Bottom dump method</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">3. Tremie</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">4. Grouted aggregate</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">5. Concrete pump</p>

<strong>Formwork:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Formwork shall be designed and constructed so as to remain sufficiently rigid during placing and compaction of concrete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The joints are plugged to prevent the loss of slurry from concrete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Stripping Time: Formwork should not be removed until the concrete has developed a strength of at least twice the stress to which concrete may be subjected at the time of removal of formwork.</p>

<strong>Compaction of Concrete:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Compaction of concrete is the process adopted for expelling the entrapped air from the concrete. The lower the workability, the higher the amount of air entrapped.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The following methods are adopted for compacting the concrete:</p>
<strong  style="margin-left: 50px;" >Hand Compaction:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>1.Rodding</p></strong>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">It is a method of poking with a 2m long, 16 mm dia. rod at sharp corners and edges.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>2. Ramming: </strong><br>- It is generally used for compaction on ground in plain </p>
<p style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>Tamping:</strong> - It is a method in which the top surface is beaten by wooden 
    cross beam of cross section 10 cm x 10 cm.<br>
    • Both compaction and levelling are achieved simultaneously.<br>
    • It is mainly used for roof slabs and road pavements.
    </strong></p>
<strong  style="margin-left: 50px;">Compaction by Vibration:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• Vibration is imparted to the concrete by mechanical means.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">• Mechanical vibration can be of various types as given under:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">1. Internal vibrator</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">2. External vibrator</p>
<strong>Curing:</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"> Curing is the process in which the concrete is protected from loss of moisture and kept within a reasonable temperature range.
The result of this process is increased strength and decreased permeability
Curing can be done by various methods, including immersion, ponding, spraying, and covering with wet sand.</p>

            <strong>Importance of Testing:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                Testing plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety, durability, and performance of materials and structures. Both non-destructive testing (NDT) and destructive testing methods have their own importance. While NDT preserves the integrity of the tested material, destructive testing provides detailed data on the material’s behavior under stress, often used for research and development purposes.
            </p>
        
            <strong>Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Methods:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                Non-destructive testing methods allow the inspection of materials without causing any harm, and they are commonly used in industries to evaluate the condition of critical structures.
            </p>
            
            <strong>1. Visual Inspection (VT):</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                A simple method that involves visually inspecting the surface of a material for any signs of flaws or defects, such as cracks or corrosion.
            </p>
        
            <strong>2. Ultrasonic Testing (UT):</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                High-frequency sound waves are used to detect internal defects in materials. The echoes of these sound waves help to locate defects or irregularities within the material.
            </p>
        
            <strong>3. Radiographic Testing (RT):</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                X-rays or gamma rays are used to penetrate materials, and the resulting images help identify internal flaws such as voids, cracks, or discontinuities.
            </p>
        
            <strong>4. Magnetic Particle Testing (MT):</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                Magnetic fields are applied to ferromagnetic materials. Defects on the surface or near the surface can be detected by the pattern formed by magnetic particles.
            </p>
        
            <strong>5. Dye Penetrant Testing (PT):</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                A liquid dye is applied to the surface of materials. The dye penetrates cracks, and after cleaning and applying a developer, defects become visible under UV or visible light.
            </p>
        
            <strong>6. Eddy Current Testing (ET):</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                Eddy currents are induced in conductive materials to detect surface and sub-surface defects. Changes in the flow of currents can indicate the presence of flaws.
            </p>
        
            <strong>7. Acoustic Emission Testing (AET):</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                This method detects the sound emitted by materials under stress. It helps to identify and locate sources of internal cracking or other failures in real-time.
            </p>
        
            <strong>8. Leak Testing:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                Used to detect leaks in sealed systems, such as pipes and tanks, through various techniques like pressure testing or helium leak detection.
            </p>
        
            <strong>Destructive Testing Methods:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                Destructive testing involves testing materials or components to failure in order to understand their properties, behavior, and performance under stress. This is useful for research and quality assurance.
            </p>
            
            <strong>1. Tensile Testing:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                A sample material is pulled apart until it breaks to measure its tensile strength, elongation, and overall behavior under tension.
            </p>
        
            <strong>2. Impact Testing:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                This test measures a material's ability to absorb energy during a collision or impact. It provides insight into a material's toughness.
            </p>
        
            <strong>3. Hardness Testing:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                In this method, the material’s surface is indented using a specified force, and the depth or size of the indentation is used to determine the hardness of the material.
            </p>
        
            <strong>4. Fatigue Testing:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                This test evaluates how materials respond to repeated stress and strain over time, which helps to determine the material's endurance limit.
            </p>
        
            <strong>5. Creep Testing:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                Creep testing measures the long-term deformation of a material when exposed to constant stress over a prolonged period, often at high temperatures.
            </p>
        
            <strong>6. Fracture Toughness Testing:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                This method determines a material's resistance to crack propagation and fracture under stress.
            </p>

            <strong>Rebound Hammer Test:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                The Rebound Hammer Test is a non-destructive testing method used to assess the surface hardness of concrete. It helps to estimate the compressive strength of the concrete based on its hardness. The rebound number is measured by the hammer's spring-driven mechanism that strikes the concrete surface and returns, providing a numerical value that correlates with the strength of the material.
            </p>
        
            <strong>Procedure for Rebound Hammer Test:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                1. The test surface should be smooth and free of any coatings or impurities.
                <br>2. Hold the rebound hammer perpendicular to the concrete surface.
                <br>3. Push the hammer against the concrete surface, allowing the spring mechanism to strike the material.
                <br>4. Record the rebound number displayed on the scale.
                <br>5. Repeat the procedure at different points of the surface to get accurate readings.
                <br>6. Compare the rebound number with the established correlation charts to estimate the compressive strength of the concrete.
            </p>
        
            <strong>Advantages of Rebound Hammer Test:</strong>
            <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <li>Quick and easy to perform.</li>
                <li>No need for sample preparation or external power sources.</li>
                <li>Can be used for testing large areas of concrete surfaces.</li>
                <li>Helps to identify uniformity and detect variations in concrete strength.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <strong>Limitations of Rebound Hammer Test:</strong>
            <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <li>Surface roughness and moisture can affect accuracy.</li>
                <li>Only measures surface hardness, not internal defects or strength at depth.</li>
                <li>Requires correlation with other tests for more accurate results.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <strong>Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Test :</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                The Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Test is a non-destructive method used to assess the quality of concrete by measuring the velocity of an ultrasonic pulse passing through the material. The pulse velocity depends on the density and elastic properties of the material, which are influenced by the presence of cracks, voids, or other defects.
            </p>
        
            <strong>Procedure for Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Test:</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                1. Place the ultrasonic transducers (transmitter and receiver) on opposite sides of the concrete specimen.
                <br>2. The transducer emits an ultrasonic pulse that travels through the concrete to the receiver.
                <br>3. The time taken for the pulse to travel through the concrete is recorded.
                <br>4. The pulse velocity is calculated using the known distance between the transducers and the time taken for the pulse to travel.
                <br>5. The pulse velocity value helps to assess the quality of the concrete, with higher velocities indicating better quality and lower velocities indicating defects or deterioration.
            </p>
        
            <strong>Advantages of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Test:</strong>
            <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <li>Can detect internal defects such as cracks, voids, and honeycombing.</li>
                <li>Can be used for testing both fresh and hardened concrete.</li>
                <li>Non-destructive and requires minimal preparation.</li>
                <li>Can be applied on structures that are already built without causing damage.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <strong>Limitations of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Test:</strong>
            <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <li>Accuracy depends on the contact between transducers and the surface.</li>
                <li>Requires a smooth surface for optimal measurement.</li>
                <li>Cannot give a direct measurement of concrete strength, only an indirect assessment of material quality.</li>
