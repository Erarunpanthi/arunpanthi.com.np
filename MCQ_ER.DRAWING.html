                            <div class="answer">Answer: b<br>
Explanation: Generally drawing board has dimensions of 1000 x 1500, 700 x 1000, 500 x 700, 350 mm x 500 mm, and made of well-seasoned soft wood, so there would be no bending while life increases. And also if a size of drawing board increases widely then the board will be fabricated with another 1 or 2 battens. </div></div><div class="card"><p style="">The part that doesn’t belong to T-square is __________<br>
a) Working edge<br>
b) Blade<br>
c) Stock<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: d<br>
Explanation: Working edge and Stock are parts of T- square those which make 90 degrees with each other, the blade is the long bar that exists in T-Square. Ebony is part of Drawing board in which T-square is fitted to draw lines.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">The angle which we can’t make using a single Set-square is ________<br>
a) 45<sup>o</sup><br>
b) 60<sup>o</sup><br>
c) 30<sup>o</sup><br>
d) 75<sup>o</sup><br>
</p>
                            <div class="options">

                            <div class="answer">Answer: d<br>
Explanation: 45<sup>o</sup> can be drawn using 45<sup>o</sup> Set-square, and 30<sup>o</sup>, 60<sup>o</sup> can be drawn using 30<sup>o</sup> – 60<sup>o</sup> Set-square, but to draw 75<sup>o</sup> degrees we need both Set-squares. That is only if we keep 30<sup>o</sup> of set-square adjacent with 45<sup>o</sup> set-square we can get 75<sup>o</sup>. And also multiple angles can be achieved using protractor.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">The angle which we can’t make using both the Set-squares is _____________<br>
a) 15<sup>o</sup><br>
b) 105<sup>o</sup><br>
c) 165<sup>o</sup><br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: d<br>
Explanation: 15<sup>o</sup> can be made by keeping 45<sup>o</sup> and 30<sup>o</sup> adjacent to each other on the line perpendicular to the line for which 15<sup>o</sup>is made. Likewise for 105<sup>o</sup> and 165<sup>o</sup> also if we just change the alignment with the required line it possible. But to make 125<sup>o</sup> there is no such combination available for Set-squares.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Small bow compass can draw circles less than _____ mm radius.<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: a<br>
Explanation: A normal Small bow compass is capable of drawing circles less than the 25mm radius. This is because of the arrangement of a screw in between the legs of the compass. But any other normal compass can’t give us perfect circles whose radius is less than 25mm.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Which is not the use of divider?<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: c<br>
Explanation: French curves are used for drawing curves which can’t be drawn with a compass. A faint freehand curve is first drawn through the known points. Longest possible curves exactly coinciding with the freehand curve are then found out from the French curve. Finally, a neat continues curve is drawn with the aid of the French curve.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">The areas of the two subsequent sizes of drawing sheet are in the ratio ____<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: c<br>
Explanation: A successive format size (from A0 to A5) is obtained by halving along the length or doubling along the width. So the areas of the two subsequent sizes are in the ratio 1:2. Likewise in reverse order (from A5 to A0), the ratio will be 2:1.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">What is the next size of 210 mm x 297 mm in drawing papers?<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: b<br>
Explanation: 210 mm x 297 mm is A4 size, next one is A3 (297 mm x 420 mm), which came doubling along the width. And the next size is obtained by doubling the width i.e. A2 (420 mm x 594mm) and so on.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">The Grade becomes ______ according to the figure placed in front of the letter B, 2B, 3B, 4B etc.<br>

    <div class="card"><p style="">Which of the following is not the pictorial projection?<br>
a) Oblique projection<br>
b) Isometric projection<br>
c) Orthogonal projection<br>
d) Perspective projection<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: c<br>
Explanation: In four different types of projections: Oblique, Isometric, and Perspective projections, we can clearly get the three-dimensional view of the object. Whereas in the orthographic projection, three-dimensional object is represented in the two-dimensional view.<br>
</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Which of the following does not use the parallel projection technique in pictorial projections?<br>
a) Perspective projection<br>
b) Axonometric projection<br>
c) Isometric projection<br>
d) Oblique projection<br>
</p>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: a<br>
Explanation: In pictorial projections, we have parallel projection and perspective projection techniques. Axonometric and oblique projections belong to parallel projections. Axonometric projections are again classified as trimetric, dimetric and isometric. Hence perspective projections cannot be drawn by parallel projection technique.<br>
</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">In perspective projection, which of the following gives the position of the observer’s eye level?<br>
a) Ground line<br>
b) Vanishing point<br>
c) Horizon line<br>
d) Station point<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: c<br>
Explanation: The horizon line in perspective projections indicates the eye level of the observer, and helps the viewer to judge the scale of the object and correct perspective to view. Vanishing point lies on the horizon line, where projection lines meet.<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: d<br>
Explanation: In oblique projection, one of the axes is inclined at some angle with the horizontal axis, which is called a receding axis, while the other two are perpendicular to each other. This receding axis makes an angle from 30° – 60° with the horizontal axis.<br>
