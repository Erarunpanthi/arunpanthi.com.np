<strong>Transportation</strong>
    <p>Movement of people and goods from one place to another place with safe, easy, comfort, economical is known as transportation.</p>
<p>Movement of people is known as <span class="highlight">passenger transportation</span>, whereas movement of goods is known as <span class="highlight">freight transportation</span>.
<p><strong>Modes of transportation</strong></p>
<p>There are two modes of transportation:<br>
<strong>Primary Modes of Transportation:</strong><br>
There are four types of Primary modes of Transportation</p>
<ol>
<li>Land-ways:</li>
<ul>
<li>Roadways: Roads, Highway, Street (Bus, Car,truck, motorcycle, etc)</li>
<li>Railways: Rails (Wagon , train , container)</li></ul>
<li>Waterways: River , Lake, sea, ocean (Ship, Boat , etc)</li>
<li>Airways : Air-route ( Aero-plane , Drone , Helicopter)</li>
<li>Space-ways : Space-route (Satellite , Rocket)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Secondary Modes</strong></p>
<p>There are four types of Secondary modes of transportation</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ropeways: Cable (car, carriage, cabin,
chair , gondola)</li>
<li>Pipeline: Pipe (Water , gas, sewer)</li>
<li>Canal : Irrigation canal (Water)</li>
<li>Belt Conveyor : Belt (Aggregates in crusher plant)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Role of Road Transportation in Rural Development of Nepal</strong>
<p>Since, over 80% population of the country living in the villages, the development in 
urban areas alone do not indicate the overall development of the country.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only with the improvement in transportation facilities in rural areas, there could be faster 
development of rural centres.</li>
<li>The fertilizers and other inputs for agriculture and cottage industries could reach the rural 
population easily and similarly the products can be sold at the nearest marketing centres for 
more remunerative price resulting in faster economic growth and decreased wastage.</li>
<li>Through the proper facility of transportation, the education, health care and other social needs 
in the village are increased and hence migration to urban centres decreases. Due to increase of 
such facilities helping in balance development of the country</li></ul>
<strong>History of Road Development in Nepal</strong>
<p>The development of roads in Nepal has evolved over time, transitioning from <span class="highlight">ancient trails</span> to <span class="highlight">modern highways</span>, significantly improving connectivity and transportation.</p>

<p><strong><span class="highlight">Ancient Trails and Trade Routes</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before the construction of modern roads, Nepal relied on <span class="highlight">traditional trails</span> and <span class="highlight">trade routes</span> for transportation.</li>
<li>Major trade routes connected Nepal to India and Tibet, such as the <span class="highlight">Kuti Pass</span>, <span class="highlight">Tatopani route</span>, and <span class="highlight">Karnali route</span>.</li>
<li>People traveled on foot, used mules, and carried goods manually.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span class="highlight">Early Road Construction (Before 1950s)</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Until the mid-20th century, there were no proper <span class="highlight">motorable roads</span> in Nepal.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Rana rulers</span> prioritized isolation, limiting road construction.</li>
<li>Some short roads existed within <span class="highlight">Kathmandu Valley</span>, but they were not linked to other regions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span class="highlight">Beginning of Modern Road Development (1950s-1970s)</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After the end of the <span class="highlight">Rana regime</span> in 1951, Nepal focused on <span class="highlight">infrastructure development</span>.</li>
<li>The first motorable road, <span class="highlight">Tribhuvan Highway</span>, was built in 1956 with Indian assistance, connecting <span class="highlight">Kathmandu</span> to <span class="highlight">Raxaul (India)</span>.</li>
<li>During <span class="highlight">King Mahendra’s rule</span>, road expansion continued with highways like <span class="highlight">Prithvi Highway</span> and <span class="highlight">Siddhartha Highway</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span class="highlight">Expansion of Road Networks (1980s-2000s)</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">East-West Highway (Mahendra Highway)</span>, Nepal's longest highway, was constructed, linking the entire <span class="highlight">Terai region</span>.</li>
<li>International support from countries like <span class="highlight">China</span>, <span class="highlight">India</span>, and <span class="highlight">Japan</span> helped in road expansion.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Rural road development programs</span> were launched to improve access to remote areas.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span class="highlight">Recent Developments and Challenges (2000s-Present)</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Projects like <span class="highlight">Mid-Hill Highway</span> and <span class="highlight">Postal Highway</span> aim to enhance connectivity across Nepal.</li>
<li>Increased focus on <span class="highlight">blacktopped roads</span>, <span class="highlight">bridges</span>, and <span class="highlight">tunnel construction</span>.</li>
<li>Challenges include <span class="highlight">landslides</span>, difficult <span class="highlight">mountainous terrain</span>, and <span class="highlight">road maintenance</span> issues.</li>
<li>Efforts continue for <span class="highlight">road widening</span>, <span class="highlight">expressway construction</span>, and <span class="highlight">sustainable road development</span>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Classification of Road in Nepal</strong>
<p>As per NRS-2070, road in Nepal is classified into two types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Administrative Classification </li>
<li>Functional /Technical Classification</li>
<ul><strong>Administrative Classification</strong>
<p>As per Administrative classification , there are four  types of road
and they are:<br>
<li><strong>National Highway/Highway/Trunk Road/Rajmarg</strong>
<p>
The road along the length of the country or across the width of the country is known
as Highway.The important or major road of a country is <span class="highlight">Highway.</span>

National Highway are designated by Capital Letter <span class="highlight">“NH” followed by two(2)</span>
digit number.

Eg: NH01 = Mahendra Rajmarga (East-West Highway) (1028 km) (AH2) , from
Mechi bridge, Jhapa Border to Gaddachowki Border, Kanchanpur.
<span class="highlight">There are Eighty (80) </span> numbers of National Highway in Nepal.</p></li>
<li><strong>Feeder Roads:</strong>
<p>The road departing from Highway and connecting to Zonal
Headquarter, District Headquarter, Economic centre or tourism area is
known as feeder roads. Feeder roads are designated by <span class="highlight">Capital Letter “F” followed by
three(3) digit number.</span>Eg: F001 = Birtamod to Chandragadhi
,Bhadrapur,12.53 km
<span class="highlight">There are 208 numbers of Feeder roads in Nepal.</span></p></li>
<li><strong>District Road</strong>
<p>The roads within the district is known as District road. District roads are represented by <span class="highlight">capital letter “DR”</span>District Roads are important roads within a district serving areas of
production and markets, and connecting with each other or with the
main highways.<span class="highlight">There are 77 District roads in Nepal.</span></p>
<li><strong>Urban Roads</strong>
<p>The roads within the metropolitan city, sub-metropolitan city, municipality or town development board is known as Urban roads.
Urban road are specially also known as <span class="highlight">street</span>A roughly circumferential roads build around an Urban areas is
known as Ring Road</p></li>
