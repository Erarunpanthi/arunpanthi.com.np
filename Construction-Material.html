b) Minerals<br>
c) Chemical compounds<br>
d) Crystals<br>
</p>
                            <div class="options">

                            <div class="answer">Answer: b<br>
Explanation: Rocks are made up of minerals. They can be monomineralic (single mineral) or polymineralic (more than one mineral).</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Which one of the following is not a classification of stones?<br>
a) Physical Classification<br>
b) Mineralogical Classification<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: b<br>
Explanation: The classifications of stones are physical (based on structure), chemical (based on chemical composition), practical (based on usage) and geological (based on the mode of origin). Mineralogical classification is not a means of classifying stones in general. It’s called chemical classification.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">The hot molten material occurring naturally below the surface of the Earth is called:<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: c<br>
Explanation: Hot molten material is called Lava when it erupts from a volcano and reaches the surface. Slag is waste material from the smelting of ore. Tuff is a porous rock formed by a consolidation of volcanic ash.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">At what depth and rate is a hypabyssal rock formed?<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: b<br>
Explanation: Plutonic rocks are formed by slow cooling of magma at considerable depth. Volcanic rocks are formed near the surface of Earth by rapid cooling of magma. Hypabyssal rocks are formed at a quick rate of cooling of magma at considerably shallow depths.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">What is a sedimentary deposit?<br>
a) Weathered product remains at site<br>
b) Weathered product carried away in solution<br>
c) Weathered product gets carried away agents<br>
d) Insoluble weathered product is carried away in suspension<br>
</p>
                            <div class="options">

                            <div class="answer">Answer: d<br>
Explanation: Weathered product remains at site is called residual deposit. Weathered product carried away in solution is chemical deposit and Weathered product gets carried away agents is organic deposit.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Which factor disturbs the equilibrium of rocks, commencing metamorphism?<br>
a) Increase in temperature<br>
b) Decrease in temperature and pressure<br>
c) Increase in temperature and pressure<br>
d) Decrease in pressure<br>
</p>
                            <div class="options">
                                <button>Show Answer</button>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: c<br>
Explanation: Rocks are stable at a temperature below 200°C and at the pressure existing. Any increase in above two factors can initiate the process of metamorphism. One factor alone is not sufficient to start metamorphism.</div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Which of the following is not a metamorphic change?<br>
a) Calcite to schist<br>
b) Limestone to marble<br>
c) Shale to slate<br>
d) Granite to gneisses<br>

                            <div class="answer">Answer: d<br>
Explanation: Foliated rocks can split up into layers along a definite direction only. Sedimentary rocks are generally stratified and igneous rocks are unstratified. </div></div><div class="card"><p style="">Granite is a type of:<br>
a) Plutonic rock<br>
b) Metamorphic rock<br>
